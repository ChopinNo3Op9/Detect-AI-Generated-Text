"Candidate what do you think of when I say that word well If I had to guess a said president. President that when  each party selects a president that the people  trust to help this Nation. candidates focuse their campaign on efforts onthe toss up state. In the article they said Nixonin 1968 and Clintin in 1992 both had only a43 percent plurality of the popular votes. No c candidate win majority.

Did you know that under 23rdAmendment of the constistution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. That what the article told me in paragraph4. Every candidate that is running for president has his or her own group of electors. the majority of 270 electoral votes is rerequired to elect the president. Everyone has to vote if want somebody that own your side. If don't then your voice will never be heard so you have speak up and vote. For who should be president of the state. So voting is a big deal so you make sure that you be heard.                             ",0
"Ever since it was first invented, the automobile has proved to be very important and practical for people all over the globe. In the current century, however, the demand for the car has begun to see a potential disappearance, as people are beginning to discover that there are advantages to minimizing their dependence on their vehicles. Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban the car free city has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the environment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the environment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rushhour every day. Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.",0
"Have you ever come back to school after a long summer break and forgot everything you previously learned? Than you probably had an easy summer project if you had one at all. Many teachers let their students off easy for summer thinking they need a break, but what they are really doing is setting them up for failure for the following year. Although some may believe otherwise student preparedness, teacher support, and students using previously learned information prove that teacher should design summer projects.

If a teacher designs a summer assignment it will most likely introduce students to things they will learn the next year. This will provide students with an opportunity to be ahead at the start of the following year and make it easier for teachers too. Teachers would not have to spend as much time teaching the students things they already learned, they can just review it and go onto harder material. This will also give students a base for the start of the following year and they will already know what to expect. Some people believe that students should have a break during the summer although I agree, you are going to have to do an assignment even if it is made by students or the teacher, so why not get a head start on the next year. This will also allow students to pull from knowledge they already have.

A good summer assignment will allow students to use what they learned the previous year. If a student is able to use what they already learned their is a much higher chance that they wont forget it. One of the worst feelings in school is when the teacher is reviewing things you need to know from the previous year and you forgot most if not all of it. Why would you want to take a class for a year and not retain the information you need to know. Doing an assignment in the summer, even if it does not pertain to the information you learned will keep your brain active and give you a better chance of remembering what you learned. Some people would say that if a student really learned the information in school than they do not need a summer assignment, But many students do not learn everything to the extent that they need to to be able to remember it the next year. One of the main reasons students dont complete summer projects is because they cant. If the students create the assignment than the teacher can not help.

If a teacher creates a summer assignment than they can give the students videos or websites that can help them. This can support the student since there will be no teacher present to help them. If students create the project than the teacher will not be able to help them at all. If students create the project some students may believe the project that they created is easy, but it is difficult for some students to learn without the support of a teacher or video. Teachers creating the assignment will make it so they can complete their project in a timely manner and still enjoy summer. Some people would say that students should have easy summer assignments that dont require assistance but this is proven wrong every year by students who do not remember previous information.

Many students do not do the summer assignment assigned to them or cram it all to the last minute because it is normally just busy work. If summer projects were assigned by teachers than they would most likely be work to help you with the upcoming year and help you remember. If this was the case than most productive students would realize the value of them and work on them in a timely manner. If students did their part by completing the assignment and teachers gave out assignments that help summer projects will no longer be looked at as busy work but as a tool to recall information and give you a head start. If students created the assignment than it would continue being looked at as busy work and a waste of time.",0
"Imagine you receiving advice from someone, but you go ask other people because you're not sure if it's considerable. What I would do in this situation is to not ask one person for advice, I would go to other people and listen to their opinions. Just by listening to different people's perspective you gain more information to help you find a reliable solution. For me, that is the correct choice because it makes more sense to absorb others advice to find a better choice. I believe everyone has the opportunity to seek others opinions to make a better choice by involving others, being curious, and relying on your peers.

By involving others, you can learn a lot of new things just by including multiple opinions. To involve other people you can start off by asking for their point of view, so they can end up changing your mind about your situation for something better. You could also involve others by using their opinion, and ask different people about that person's perspective, and see which one would lead you to make a final choice. Finally, another way to involve others to seek a better choice is by expressing your own opinion, and talking to another person to observe your opinion. I find these ways better to trust, so you don't have to involve only one person.

Being curious helps you find a better belief about a situation you are not sure of. To be curious you could go up to people for advice, and possibly give them options to see which one has a better meaning. On the other hand, you could be curious by listening to what is important or not, and by asking for examples if you don't quite understand. Asking multiple questions of the person's advice and finding the pro's and con's of the situation is another way of being curious. Being curious is the key to lead you to the right path to find a better choice.

Relying on your peers can help you find a better understanding of their advice. An example of relying on others is to build trust with a variety of people to make sure you know that person will give you a positive result. Another way to rely on your peers is to make sure you know them well enough to ask them for advice, and so that you don't go the opposite way of making a consistent choice. However, relying on your peers will make you feel more confident about their opinions, and consider making the right choice. Relying on others will help you follow success by considering others perspectives.

Overall, I think listening to other people's point of view is the key to help you make a better choice. Using your peers and your surroundings will get you to the right path. To make better choices, and using the opportunity to seek opinions is to involve others, be curious, and rely on your peers to find your solution. Have you ever thought about talking to other people to find reliable advises? Do you think this will help in the future as well?",0
"If you waych the news chaces are you probelly hear about cars weither it be from car accidents, to drunk driving, to pollutents from cars. And everyone is in uproar about how do we stop all this stuff from happening well it could as simple as using cars less often. This maybe sound shocking to most people who drive but maybe if we use our cars less there would be less accidents or drunk driving and not to mention less greenhouse gasses. Did you know that 50% of greenhouse gas comes from cars in car-intesive areas in the United States. Thats right 50% of those greenhouse gasses come for your car. I'm not saying we should stop driving cars in general but make an effort to use them less. Like in Bogota Columbia they have a day dedicated to not driving cars and instead using public trainsportation. From doing this they improved there sidewalks, reduced traffic and even upscale restaurants and shopping centers sprouted up. And every year everyone is happy and very ethustiastic about the day. Not only does the less usage of cars make people happy it also makes the likelyhood of car accidents very low since there are no cars on the road.    ",0
"Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! Trust me. We all need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great oppertunity to help those in need to recover their food supplies. Doing this can help you be more aware of the people in need and help you know that you have been great help to them. This program hires men to take care of the horses, cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. This can make you come closer to the animals and let them know that you care very much for them!

Not only can you help, but this job does inquire some fun! You have the benifit to see and tour special landmarks and places that you have never seen before! It is quite an adventure! It is an unbelievable oppertunity to see all kinds of sites (especially on the job!).

On board, you can also find time to have fun! When you are on return trips after the animals are unloaded, you can play many games such as baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis in the empty holds where the animals stay. Fencing, reading, whittling, fun games, and boxing make some boat trips exciting!

Overall, taking part in the seagoing Cowboys program is an excilent oppertunity! It is more of a new world rather then just an site-seeing adventure! Taking part in this activity would make you feel better about helping not just your community, but citizens beyond your community, too! Helping those who need your support is quite the heroic thing to do!   ",0
"There can be many advantages and disadvantages to having a car but the advantages to not having a card greatly outweighs having one. There can be many reasons why not having a car is great but the main three are it reduces pollution, reduces stress, and having less cars reduces the noice pollution in a city. Can you imagine a place with no cars?

First off the main advantage of limiting car use is less pollution. Cars account for 12% of gas emissions in Europe and 50% in America. Without cars the air would be much cleaner and the Smog would be gone over the cities. London had so much smog over the city that they had to cut car use in half with all of their citizens. After only five days most of the smog was gone and people could go back to driving. Imagine if we had everycar in the world stopped driving we could get rid of most of the smog in less than one week.

Another great point on how limiting car use can help is it will reduce the stress greatly in peoples lives. In the first source a man from Vauban Germany said, ""When I had a Car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Also another man from Columbia said during a day without cars, ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" Most stress comes from roadrage or getting stuck in a major traffic jam. Imagine how stresless people will be without cars Finnaly reducing car use will greatly reduce the noice pollution everywhere. When you go out side whats the first thing you hear? People? children? NO, all you can hear is the engine of cars everywhere. In a city where they banned most cars the sound of childrean drown out the occasional car engine not the other way around. Can you imagine how peacefull that would be not waking up to the sound of cars?

In conclusion having a car can have its advantages but limiting there use would be far better for people. It would help stop air pollution, reduce stress, and reduce noice pollution in cities and suburbs.",0

"Dear Principle,

The Policy 1 think would be better to use is policy 1 which states "" Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time"" because, there will be less students using phones in the class room, not as many students will be sent to the office, and is better then policy 2 ( no phones at all).

Policy 1 would be a better solution for the cell phones because, less students will be using them in the classrooms. By having less students using them in the classrooms more will be paying attention to what the lesson is, instead of focusing on how to make sure the teacher doesn't see the phone they are trying to hide. Having the students pay attention in class it will raise there grade. By having the phones out during lunch or any free time gives the students the advantage to reach a parent if needed, to remind or ask a question.

Letting the students have their phones out during lunch or free time is a better solution for the phone problem because, not as many students will be sent to the office for phone issues. Most of the time when a student is seen with a phone the teacher takes it. The student is then angry and ready to fight back for their property. As the teacher and student fight back and fourth the teacher then decides to send the student out for talking back and being disrespectful. Not only now do you have a child who is mad because they lost their phone but is in more trouble for being rude.

Policy 1 is a better solution than having no phones at all because we are now back to the beginning. Now we have student sneaking their phones, being uncivil, and lets add on angry parents. Now we have parents who have to take time out of their work day to come and pick their child's phone up, or having to talk with the teacher about what had happen. So all in all we have a student who lost their phone, sent to the office, and now is in trouble at home, all because he/she couldn't wait to say something.

As you can hopefully see policy 1 is a much better discovery than policy 2 which states no phones allowed. In conclusion by using policy 1 you have a better day and so does your student! So make the switch to policy 1!",0
"Schools that have the option to attend classes online or video conferencing, are more likely to improve students learning. Since 2009 schools started to provide this program to the community. Most of the families on the area thought this program was useless, but families from far distance thought this was a brilliant idea. This programs took place at Generic_School. There were around ninety-two students involve. The first year was a success, and so the second one.

After that the numbers of students started to decrease. Why there were less students involve to the program?. What can we do to fix this issue? Why people from the area thought this was useless?. Why people from far distance thought this was a brilliant idea?.

When this program for students to attend classes online or video conferencing took place at Generic_School on September 2, 2009. There were ninety-two students involve, all of them liked this program but only the 70% of them joined for the next year. The second year only sixty-five joined the classes online. The comments they left were; ""It's nice to be home and take classes online, and its awesome to no worry about being late to class, but as a student i've love to share ideas, thoughts with other students"". Since the third year of this program the number of students decrease to 10%. Since 2011 about twenty students joined the online program. The numbers decrease because students felt that being home all day was boring. No being able to share ideas with other students or get engage with them. Students thought they needed more activities and less standing in only one place.

There are some ways to get students interested again to the program. On the online classes there are choices before joining any class. Those choices are that if she/he is willing to go out and do projects with others students that are taking the same classes as them. They are able to chat with them and get information,and choose the day of the meeting. But if they don't want they could either do video chat with other students or just a voice chat. Other options could be that students will have the option to visit the school once a week or once a month. If this options works, for sure more and more students will be involve.

Many folks from the area in 2009 thought that this online classes were useless, because since it was opened for anyone less and less students will attend to school. Some of those families even came to talk to the principal and said "" For many years our goal is to get students to attend to school, and with program out our goal will fail"", as a respond. The principal said "" For sure, we want as many students possible to attend school, but for some reasons not all them can make to school, and as a benefit and an opportunity for others to learn we decide to make this program"". The principal made many reunions with parents that disagree with this idea. After a month must of them accepted and understood the goal of the program.

People from far distance thought this was a brilliant idea, because they will not have to travel long time of terms everyday to get to school. Money will be save, and a great and big opportunity for their kids to learn from home. Families from far distance came together and as a act of greatness, they made donation to the school for actives such as soccer, track or others. The school knew that they really made the families happy and that was their goal. Happiness and make everyone comfortable in their leaning.

Schools should always look out for those that don't have the opportunity to travel to school, or live far from schools. Those who travel or cant travel to school because of the distance they have between their home and school, now the opportunity to save money, prepare their self to a better feature. Online or video conferencing classes are a really a big way to start helping the community.

After that program and if it became a success, Generic_City should see what are other ways they can do to help the community and make their learning easier. So that many teenagers will success in life.",0
"Technology and Driving

Have you ever been riding in the car and looked over at a red light and saw someone on their phone? I see it all the time when I go places with my parents, though we know it is illegal today in GA and other state people still do it. Driving is an activity that requires all your attention. My mom would always you are not only driving for yourself but for everyone on the road. No one should be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle to ensure safety for all drivers and even pedestrians.

Being a driver means you are responsible for your life and others driving and existing around you. Unfortunately, driving accident statistics gathered by edgarsnyder. com says, 1out of every 4 accidents in the US is caused by phone use while driving. That is a large portion of accidents and if we cannot use our phones while driving to rid a quarter of accidents then its worth it. The countless amounts of stories about parents and friends losing loved ones to accidents is an untimely loss that can never be justified, and we should do everything we can to spare people from a hurt such as that.

Outside of accidents leading to loss of life because of cell phone use while driving there is also the issue of distractions. A cellphone is like a computer, a MP3 player, a videogame and many other entertaining things wrapped up in one. Using this addictive piece of technology while driving is like asking for a distraction and distractions or lack of awareness of the road leads to car crashes. There might not be any deaths, but a car crash is still something to avoid. Raising your car insurance? A bad thing. Having to get your car or parent's car repaired? A bad and expensive thing. A distracted driver is a driver more likely to crash and damage their own and others' property.

There are some cars that have automated cellphone connection and touchless operations. Those vehicles do prevent the distractions, but you could still argue it is still just as bad as drunk driving. Your eyes may be on the road, but your attention is focused towards voice commands to your cellphone. It may be loosely related, but you can still be so focused on listening to that text and voicing a response that you alert enough for all the unexpected things that can happen on the road. People find that to be the compromise, but it's also seen as a mental distraction.

Overall cellphones just should not be matched with an activity such as driving. Driving should be a moment to unplug and focus even GPS can be used without the use of your cellphone. Cellphones have been proven to cause car accidents, distractions and crashes. Just keep your hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and attention focused and your cell phone will be waiting on you when you get to your destination.

"Your attitude is the best way to achieve your goals or just a plus to get everything easily. In life if your attitude is pleasant you will have a lot of opportunities, and also be succesful in work, love, and friends. For example if you help your partners in work, and do your work well probable your boss prometed you in a better stand for all your effort and devotion. Another example can be in love if you are affectionate, charismatic, and loving probably you gonna find someone love you and give you the same love, and actitud you have with her.

To begin with, the best way to get a best position in your work is to show a good attitude. The majority of contrators like someone everyone loves too, because is more effective to everyone and effective for the company. For example last year in my uncle work someone will be ascent, 3 workers inclued my uncle, the most part vote for him because they said is the most friendly, and the most appropiate for the jod. To conclude this if your attitude like the others everyone wiil be agree with you and they going to follow you because they trust you.

Secondly, the best manner to be in love with your partner is havening a great attitude, and communication. The most part of relationship work, because both respect each other, and have a great communication. For example my Mom and my Dad never fighting they prefer talk and solve them problems and teach me how is not necessary have a load attitude to solve a problem. This show how have a good attitude is the best way to prevent the love gone and preven divorces.

Some people say, is not always neccesary have a good actitud to be succesful in life. A lot porcent of people think have a bad attitude is a caracteristic to be succesful and is not a obstacle to have a great career in the future. For example the president of my country his attitude is disagreeable but he has a faultless career and although he is likeable is the president of El Salvador. However everyday people say ''he is the president because we need him no because we want he lider us''. This demostrate how you can have a good career or power, but if your attitude is unpleasant although they need it never gonna like you.

People with good personality and good attitude have the benefit to get everything more easy for how you expresed to others. And people who have a weird attitude no matter what they said if they sttil have that attitude and don't chance people never gonna try have a friendship with them for this reasons. In conclusion be a person charismatic a great friendship with the most part of the people your life will be benefit and different just to have a good attitude.",0
"The Electoral College is an important process of voting in the president. Many citizens believe that it should not exist and the president should be voted in by popular vote. It's not that simple.

Without the Electoral College, the president might not be thoughtfully voted in. The Electoral College exists for the congress to decide who becomes president and vice president. In the society we live in today, many of the young are voting for who promises stuff that they care about, but not the candidate who is the most qualified and truthful. Congress examines all the information and chooses who would represent the United States the best and who would run the country with an iron first and improve the nation.

If Congress didn't use the Electoral College system, the nation could go corrupt. The ""popular vote"" could be only by a few votes, and the other half of the nation could get extreamly angry and rebel in protest. This could possible start another civil war. By keeping the Electoral College, this would not happen. The country votes, and that counts a little towards the new president. Otherwise, the country is satisfied with the Electoral College system and is used to it by now so won't get upset if who they voted for isnt chosen. Congress, who carefully reviews each candidate, chooses who is the most qualified and votes. Depending on the population of each state, the sentors and representatives get to vote too.

The Electoral College system has been part of the United States voting system since the Constitution was signed, and should stay as our main system of voting to keep this country as it originally was and true to its meaning. This is the most effective way of choosing the best candadite for keeping our nation united and strong.    ",0
"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you have made a new rule, that any students that do not have a B average can not participate in any school activities, including sports, music and more. I fully believe that you are on the right track, students need to be able to keep up with there school work and activities. I think that if the student is passing the class they should be able to participate, not be able to, because they do not have a B average.

Most Junior High or High School kids may get a C or a D as long as they are not failing in the class and is doing pretty well I believe they should still be able to participate. If the student may get a C or a D they should be talked to or informed by a teacher to be warned they need to improve on there school work in order to participate in the school activities. Many students that are involved in sports and after school activities juggle them, school work, chores at home, and somewhere in there sleep. It is a big responsibility for some students, and may mean a lot to them. So if a student may get a C or a D on a couple of papers which will bring there grade down to a C they should still be able to attend whatever they may be interested in. As I said in the beginning of my letter, the student should still be notified about his or her grade and that they may need to find some extra credit to bring the grade up, or a tutor, or even just working harder!

I am glad you are listening to the views of the students to see what we have to say. Grades are very important, I just think it would be more fair if students could still attend the events unless they were not passing. I hope I have helped in some way, I really hope you understand what I had to say every student should be able to attend or participate in whatever they may like with out a failing grade.",0
"Cars have become an every day part of our lives, not just for Americans but, for the world. We rely on our cars for everything, from getting to work or getting food to eat, our cars are what gets us there. But what would happen if we were banned from using our cars. Many places have banned cars, whether permanently or for just a few days, cars are being banned. Cars create stress, the also create harmful pollution, that damages our health and our planet. Another reason is that cars are naturally dying out and becoming used less, than before.

In a small community of residents, cars have been completely banned. These are people who gave up there cars to live in this car-free environment. This is an area of about 5,500 people who has gave up, or possible sold there car to live here. Many of the people find that it is more relaxing, than when they had to worry about their car. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" Heidrun Walter expresses, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" From a statistic taken from this area, it shows that 70 percent of people in Vauban do not own cars, the others who couldn't give up there cars completely had to pay $40,000, along with their house to buy a garage all the way at the end of the development. This has create a car-free. along with a stress free environment for the suburban pioneers.

Cars let out exhaust that is created from gasoline and diesel. This exhaust is also know as pollution, which damages our planet, along with our own health. In Paris, cars were banned partial because, of the dirty air in this world know city. For five days a terrible smog engulfed the city, leaving the people no choice but to not allow any cars to be driven, until this smog cleared out. According to the information from ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" almost 4,000 drivers were fined for continuing to drive there vehicles. The only exceptions to this car ban was plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying more than three passengers, which causes less pollution. After a few days the restriction of cars was lifted, and cars could be driven after all the smog cleared.

The last reason we should limit our use of cars is because everyone else is stopping car use. We see hundreds of cars filling up highways, parking lots, or just driving down the road. But what we don't realize is how much car usage has dropped. In the passage, ""The End of Car Culture,""  Adviser of Perspectives Doug Shorts explaining that "" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" So are cars naturally dying out, or is there something that is causing it to drop so steadily? One theory is that many Americans can't afford a new car, also many unemployed people are not driving to work anymore. This leads to the question, are cars dying out, or are Americans just unable to get their hands on a new car?

We need to protect our planet and ourselves. With all this car usage, we are killing our planet and ourselves. We are releasing pollution into our air every time we crank a vehicle and drive. Then we proceed to inhale this infected air, which hurts us. Then we worry about our car, putting ourselves into stressful environment. This also causes harm to ourselves. So the next time you want to drive somewhere right up the road, put the keys down, and follow the trend.                                    ",0
"Do you feel that it is safe for someone to have their phone while driving? I believe that that there are reasons why you should and shouldn't be able to have your phone while driving. For example one of the reasons i believe that driving and being on your phone is dangerous is that many accidents can be caused. By that i mean when being on your phone you have no time to pay attention to the road. When driving your attention should be focused on the road at all times when looking down on your phone you can't tell who or what is coming at you, which is a easier way to cause you and or someone else to be injured.

Another reason i believe that it is dangerous for you to be on your phone and driving is because this is now another way to get arrested. By this i mean now if you're riding with your phone in sight the police is liable to arrest you. By doing this you're risking your freedom. Not only are you risking your freedom you're also putting others in harms way. By this i mean what if someone is walking in the cross walk and you happen to be on your phone and accidentally hit someone then not only is that more charges but that's also you injuring an innocent bystander.

There are also good reasons why you should be able to have your phone while driving. For example when going to a place and not knowing the directions your phone has a built in navigation system to help you get there. You don't always have to have your phone in your hand you can buy the stand where your phone can sit on that way you can see both your phone and the road.

So it isn't always bad having your phone while driving.

Another good reason to have your phone while driving is because what if there is an emergency and that is the only way someone can contact you, you don't have to hold your phone you can always get Bluetooth and or wireless headphones. By doing this you are preventing accidents from happening and your also preventing yourself and or anyone else from being in danger. Not only that but you are also able to focus on both the road and the situation that may be happening.

These are the reasons why i believe that having your phone while driving is both a good and bad thing. There are many more reasons why but these are my main three. By stating these i hope that people take caution while using there phones while driving. Now that reasons are listed i hope that people look out for themselves as well as others.         ",0
"Do you like helping people while having fun? If you do then I've just the right job for you. This wonderful job is called the UNRRA. There are many reasons why you should join the UNRRA to be a seagoing Cowboys. Some in which include trips, hanging out, ETC. Today we are going to be going over or covering if you will some of the reasons that you should join the seagoing cowboys in the UNRRA.

First of all many people say that you whould nothing out of this organization, but you really get a lot of things out of this organization. One reason you should join the seagoing cowboys is you get many trips around the world. For example, in "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke said that he got to go all around the world like: China, Europe, Greece, ETC. You actuall get to go all over the world.

Second is that you get to hang out with people you might not know, and who knows you might make a friend, meet your new best friend or even find that perfect someone for you. If you do meet someone then you would be able to hang out a lot. You could have your first date with that perfect someone in a different contry. How cool whould that be! If you don't believe me you can go back to thee text and look in paragraph 5. If I recall it says that he was able to go see many touring spots, and had a lot more free time then you think.

Speaking of touring that brings me to my next point you are able to go sight seeing and touring. You can go to many places in China and Europe. For example, If you are in Europe and you are close or near Italy you can go and see the leaning tower of piza. For lunch you can go and get some delisous Italian pizza. Now to me that sounds like the perfect day.

Others might argue by saying that all of this is too expensive and it cost a lot of money. What the people that say this don't see is that the organization pays for most of the cost. Sometimes I bet you that the people that go on this trip don't even spend a dime or a penny.

In coclusion as you can see by all of the evidence I have showed that there is no doubt in the world that you should not join this organization UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. To me all of this kind of sounds fun like a vacation. It doesn't sound like a job at all it sounds refreshing to be able to be at work while doing soomething that seems like fun and a vacation. In conclusion judging by everything I have stated I think that you should join the seagoing cowboys. I know that I will join the seagoing cowboys, will you join?      ",0
"Indead, using a car is important when traveling far distances. When fellow citizens dont traval far they can easily limit car usage. There are antiquet number of advantages of limiting car usage. It can help reduce greenhouse emissions and helping our socient without depending on our automobiles.

To begin with, limiting car usage can help reduce greenhouse emissions from tail pipes. According to experts in source 1: In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

""Experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes.... passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""

These statistics are very high in our air pollution and can even get higher as time pases. Just with taking your bike to school, work, and other hobbies you are saving fossil fuels and most importantly you are reducing air pollution!

in addition to limiting car usage, we can help our society without depending on their automobiles. As stated in

""In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, stated ""all of our developement since World War II Has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Indead this has to change because one day your automobile mightbrake down in the middle of getting to work or other hobbies. There is one thing for sure a bike wont break down and your to legs wont either.

Generally speaking, there are antiquet number of advantages on limiting car usage. Walking or riding a bike down a couple blocks help reduce air polluton. Your are saving our atmostphere and our Earth by riding a bike to a convinience store. Before driving your automobile down a couple of blockes ask yourself if you have to or if you need to!            ",0
"Dear senator,

I think that the presidential election should be settled by popular vote.  We people are being run as a country by the president, and we should be able to have more of an impact choosing who our president will be.

The president currently gets chosen in the Electoral College, a process in which the electors vote for President and Vice President after they are selected.  This process flows very well and the president is chosen easily, so its good.  The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors.  The majority being 270 electoral votes and the first president to get to this number in the race wins.  We the people are separated into states and the states get however many electoral votes based on population.  So the bigger states get more say on who's President, but I mean that makes sence because more citizens live there.  There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote.

You may think that the people are mainly voting for the President in the Electoral Collage process, but we're not.  The people just vote for electors who in turn elect the President.  Some of the slates of electors may even vote for who they want to and forget about what the majority of the state wants.  At the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system in each state.  This means that if say Florida has twenty-nine electoral votes, then all twenty-nine go to the candidate who wins that state.  ""So normaly candidates don't spend time in states they know they have know chance of winning, focusing only on the ""swing states"" and the larger populated states.""  ""Swing states"" are states that pay close attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing cadnidates.  This means that the states may pick the republican or democrat.  Some states pick the same way every election.  During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina.  I mean what kind of madness is that, how are they supposed to know who to choose.  Thats not fair and it shouldn't be settled that way.  This all just proves that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

Therefore the Electoral Collage shouldn't be the way to elect the President and Vice-President and should be either altered or in my opinion scratched.  So then they should be elected by popular vote, so we have more control on who runs the country.

Sincerely,

Luke    ",0
"The Face, a discovery on Mars. It was dicovered on 1976 and it was complicated to predict what it actually was. It was explored when NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible land places for the ship Viking 2.

When it was revealed to be a natural landform, not everyone was happy with it. The Face should be considered a natural landform.

I claim that it's a natural landform because it can be found on this earth. It wouldn't be a natural landform if it was not possible to find it anywhere. To confirmed it's identity, Mars global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997 after 18 years of the discovery. Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's MGS stated, ""We felt is was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as could get a good shot at it."" This senteces here shows how important is was to identify the Face.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. After they snapped photos of the Face, it was later revealed to be a natural landform. There was no alien monument after taking a look at the pictures. According to the text, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,7). Many people disagreed that is wasn't a natural landform, but an alien.

The camera used to take the picture wasn't an ordinary camera. It was the aboslute best camera at that time and it zoom in three times bigger than the pixel size. Some might argue that it could be hidden by a haze or mistaken, but it was looked over for the second time and it was confirmed to be a natural landform twice. If you were to use the camera that they used, you can identify any objects such as an airplane or Eygpt pyramid on Mars.

Overall, the Face is a natural landform. The landform is common around American West. Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" It's comparing a real landform to the Face. The Face today can be considered a natural landform.              ",0
"The face is just a rock formation that looks like a face due to the shadows which gives it eyes, nose and a mouth. the formation is normal and it is located in cydonia and it reminds alot of people of a mesa.

Many conspiracy theorists say that this is something thaat nasa should not have put out for all to see. they say that in the picture that was sent out was too foggy and that it was hiding things in the fog.

When this face first appeared on there monitors, they were surprised, but allitle bit after that they decided that it was just another mesa, which was common in the place that they found it at, which would be in Cydonia. they said that it just had unusual shadows that gave it the looks of a persons face.

They knew that it was just a martian mese, so they decided to let everyone else see this amazng picture, hoping that they could gather the attention of the public. it did do that which was great but then they wanted to know more. so then when NASA launched another mission for mars they decided to take another picture of the face, which this time it was alot clearer for the people to see that it was just another martian mesa.

People still weren't happy with those pictures, the people didn't know how hard it is to get it in the right place for another picture, but NASA was willing to get another picture for the people to finally prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. they took the picture with the camera's maximum resolution, so that the people could see everything in the picture clearly. although some people might not be satisfied, many people are.

"Is it a good idea to force students to participate in extracurricular activities? Extracurricular are set in place to allow students to expand on what they want for their future which should be optional. Being forced to do these could discourage students from what they want to be by having it forced upon them. Clubs and participating in yearbooks could help students make friends and build social skills. In my opinion extracurricular activities should be optional, expand more on student ideas and grades while also helping build social skills.

Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory by any means because they are made to be optional. If any student was forced to do any extracurricular activity it could make that topic boring for them. Having mandatory sports for example could make that teams hype lower. Having students that do not want to be on yearbook on yearbook might make it turn not as expected. Extracurricular activities can help build a students understanding of a topic that they are interested in.

These activities could count toward extra credit if needed for lower grades and help them improve. This could help them for later in life with college. Extra activities could make the student want to help other students in what they want to do. Activities like sports could help students make money in the future if they are good at them. Extracurricular activities could help students make friends if they choose to help other students.

Helping other students would be good at building teamwork for things like sports. Helping other students could make students better tutors. When students are better tutors they could possibly teach a younger generation as well. Social skills could help students apply for jobs and make themselves look better for better opportunities. Working with other people could help the student have a better understanding of what other people may be struggling with in a topic.

As explained extracurricular activities are nice thing to have for these reasons and my opinion is that they should be kept but not forced to be done. Activities are meant to be enjoyed not exploited by the higher staff of the school. Pushing students to do something could possibly be bad for their state of mind and personality. In the end do not make them do it but leave them as an option.",0
"Dear Principal,

I have just heard that you wanted to change the policy where now you have to have a B to play sports. I think that this is very wrong to do. I believe in the ""No pass, no play"", which means that you should be able to make a C and still play sports. In fact, by making this change you could very well sideline some of your best players because they make a C. I understand that your grades mean everything, but it is not right to make players sit the bench because they don't make A' s or B' s. I believe that some people, even though they don't make good grades, are meant to earn a college scholarship to play football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, or even run track. I believe you should consider letting C' s slide.

I don't think this is totally right. If you do this, you might not could even field a team, which is very bad. We have a pretty good athletic program, which could drastically change very quickly if you change the policy. Thank you for your time.

With utmost respect,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"Dear principle

I understand that you would like to change the grade policy from

C average to a B average for playing sports. I think this is a bad idea. we should have the limit be a C average because, not all students can foucuce as good as others, some students already know that they want to play sports for a living, and some students cant do everything at school.

Not all students can foucuce as good as others. some students have very short attention spans. some students are really good at paying attention wile others may have something holding them back. When students have a lot on their mind, something bad has happened, or they have a disabilities that is making it so they cant fouscus that causes them so miss stuff in school so they don't quite know every thing.

some students already know that they want to play sports for a living

Some students already know that they want to play sports for a living. School is suppose to help you decide what you what to do as a career. If a student already knows what they want to do then having elective classes are completely pointless. Students should be able to decide if they want electives.

Some students cant do everything at school. Some students may have ADHD or ADD with causes them to have a short attention span or not be able to focus and or pay attention.

Other students may have a lot on their mind such as the death of a loved one or fights with friends. This may cause them to be distracted and not focus so they cant work.

so again I understand that you would like to change the grade policy from a C average to a B average. I think this is a bad idea. we should have the limit be a C average because, not all students can focus as good as others, some students already know that they want to play sports for a living, and some students cant do everything at school.",0
"The Face on Mars was not made from an ancient alian civilization. We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa.

The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos."" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform.

When the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows.

Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.

Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa.",0
"Its been debated that projects over the summer ensure that students are still learning. It also has been debated whether or not teachers or students should be able to design them. Students should be able to design there own projects because they will create something that they will excel in, allows a time for personal growth, and they are able to acquire skills that are used in the real world today.

First, Students over the summer are less interested in doing school work. If they are allowed to design a project for themselves this gives them the opportunity to excel. Students will be able to design a project that they are interested in. When they are interested they are able to have a greater amount of motivation to complete the project. Students could be able to research and complete a project that really means something to them. If a student is really interested in a from of art or music then they could keep there project separate from one who is really into sports. Student designed means that the project meant something to them.

Also,student design projects give the student a time for personal growth. Most of the time students rely on teachers to give them assignments that will help them grow and achieve in life. Putting that on the students would allow them to take more of a role in there own learning and assume responsibility. Summer is the students personal time knowing that they could design there project creates a less stressful environment for them and puts it more on enjoying the project and less on what the teacher will do and say. For example if a student is traveling to a foreign country over the summer they could complete there project while they are there.

Finally, when doing a project it is know and proven that projects help those involved learn a different set of skills. In this day an age lots of the more recent jobs require you to have these setts of skills. Projects help people learn how to plan ahead for an important date, the right resources to use for research, and how to work with other people. Im sure that the list of skill could go on but those are a few of the most important ones. Most the things that students learn in school dont always get applied in the real world. But when students are able to learn and apply these skills on there own thats when they become more prepared to succeed. A few years back I was able to create my own end of the year project using a topic we had learned through out the year in my civics project. For the first time I felt a lot more motivation to do this project to my best of my ability to really show what i had learned. I liked that I was able to make my own schedule. This project felt more fun then stressful I liked the fact that I felt like I was in control.

Some may say that allowing a student to plan a project and design it them selves in wrong because its a teachers job to design the assignment. Students that would be allowed to create and design there own projects have a higher chance of success because they are more motivated, can keep there own schedule, and can be able to develop more project based skills that they can then use in today's society.    ",0
"one day on Feb 29th, Generic_Name did not have the best looking shoes at school. He started getting bullied and he had multiple choices but wasn't aware of all. Generic_Name started asking people for advice. Therefor he has got multiple point of views on his own situation. Although he could use some help, that still did not mean every point of view would make his problem the best.

advice was gvin and point of views but not every single one made his situation worse. Generic_Name uncles had started giving advice, although Generic_Name friends gave him advice to. Generic_Name knew for sure it still was right to go to older people like adults. some friends said you could fight the big bully, by better shoes and etc. Some of the adult point of views was, tell an important person at school, teachers, school workers and etc. was some of his advice able to help? If so how can the advice help? advice could help for many different situation because almost everybody has advice from past events that happen to them which is good because people can share there advice to help other people.

How can advice help? advice can help you in a situation, but also if you get the wrong advice it can cause the wrong thing to occur and a bad idea for the future. advice can help you understand the situation from a few people thinking and opinions. Ex:

imagine an puzzle, your thinking is a piece to the puzzle but when you get multiple thoughts from others, which is other point of views that can help you gather everybody point of view and advice. When you get different information you can put all the different advice into one whole point of view on an situation.

My great great grandma always said

""just listen to some advice it can help through stages of life.""

Always be open minded some people can give you negative advice. Although you can think advice helps, it can help if others are giving it to you positive. Most likely people who give good advice they made it farther on from one of there own mistakes or situations they had to deal with. some people want different reactions and try to cause you to do negative actions and negative things although its better perspectives and advice your able to get.

Although advice is mostly good and helpful. You're still getting an part of an opinion, when getting an part of an opinion its still and idea. Although you are getting opinions its your job to turn all the opinions to your own idea or which you think is best to help yourself out in your own situation. When others are giving you opinions you still have to keep in mind that it is an opinion and its not always the right thing even though opinions are in the vocabulary when we have an conversation about others giving each other advice. Most advice you should most definitely pay full attention to, and use and dont take for granted an put some use to it because in life advice can always help you and get you some where farther. One day you can turn it around and give others advice. Everyday you could be giving advice even if you dont know you are. ",0
"Dear Principle,

I believe Policy 2 would be a better decision. I think it would be a better decision because then students would not be distracted my phone calls and text messages. Choosing Policy 2 may also increase a students ability in school. They may test higher and have better grades. Also, students can get a better job due to their grades.

Students may be distracted by phone calls and text messages because they may not turn off their phone or they bring it to school in the first place. The students may even have their phone on ring which may distract their fellow class mates or even the teacher.

Students also may be distracted from their phones when it comes time for learning. If we take phones out completely the students may get better grades and test higher. They can even get into a better college than what they would have if they were on their phones all the time. That leads to a good job to support their lives and, if they have a family, their families lives.

They may not be aware of this, partly because they may be on their phones, but they can get better jobs if they stay off their phones and on the books. They would not only get better jobs but they even can be paid more than what they would have if they wouldn't have gotten better grades.

The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones.

Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.

"Some students may think that taking classes online is the best thing for them. Meanwhile, the other half of students think going to school suits them the most. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because it would be easier for them to stay focused, give themselves as much time as possible, and get to know what the best and correct choice is for them.

Majority of the time kids struggle focusing in a class full of friends and strangers, which causes them to lose focus in the assignments they're given and start having conversations with other classmates. Some know that they're the type of person that can't keep their mind in one certain place, so their minds wonder off into a whole different planet. Meanwhile the other half of students know that they're capable of staying focused no matter what the situation is. Doing work online though, prevents all of that from happening. It gives students time to think about what exactly it is that they're doing and need to get done, and prevent any mistakes from happening on a certain task or assignment. Staying focusing is very important, if students stay focused then they'll get things done in time or even done before the actual due date or time, and not have to worry about doing it later on.

Giving them enough time as possible to get tasks done is important. Most teachers will give you a certain time limit to get things done, which of course will cause them to get it done in the certain amount of time they were given so that they get it all done as quick as possible. Online on the other hand, can also have certain due dates and times that you have to turn work in but you're more relaxed and calm about things because you have more time in your hand and can think things more in depth, instead of just having to think of things right out of the top of their heads. Doing things on their own time and paste is best for any student, they can find it easier to concentrate and don't have to think oh no I still haven't finished this, or it's almost time to hand it in but i'm barely done with the first section.

As students spend more time alone, they sometimes tend to think about what's best for them as an individual. Some might say that, they work better independently, because they know they aren't able to handle being around other students 24/7, losing their ability to focus, or just hate being around people in general because they know what others are capable of. Whereas, other students may think the opposite and feel like they can work being around other people no matter what type of situation they're in. Just working alone can get them to really go in some deep thinking about what's the best descision for them and know what's going to be the best choice in the future or even in the present.

In conclusion, I think attending classes from home has plenty of benefits, like giving students more time to think, having a lot more time to focus, and getting to know whats best for them. Just imagine being in a class full of 100 students everyday, all talking at the same exact time and yelling across the classroom trying to get friends attention, what would you do? ",0
"Can you imagine a world where no one has to ride the city bus or try to get a taxi? This could happen in the future if companies like Google continue to try to upgrade their driverless cars. This idea is just in the very early steps at the moment, but with more regulated test-drives and advances in technology this could be a reality.

There are many questions like: If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? If this technology was put into action before it was ready for every possiblity then the blame would fall upon the manufacturer and the government for it's approval. The only cars that are close to completely driverless still require the human to be in the driver's seat and remain focused at all times if needed to take over in certain situations. Computers do not make mistakes, humans do. If not laced with the best programming and top of the line technology, this car could be a failure.

Everything falls back on the maufacturers. If they can provde the world with a driverless car that is reliable and keeps humans out of harms way it would be amazing. Until the driverless cars are perfected they should not be used by the public. The blame if something goes wrong should only be placed on the maufacturers who were relied on to make a safe and easy alternative to human-controlled cars we use today. riverless cars is an idea that can soon be achieved with the right research and testing.

"I'm very interested in the nurse and now there's an opportunity that school tell us to strive for an internship in this hospital, i'm very glad to attend this competition. Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people.

First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. There's some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, it's a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, i'm fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i can't learn from the book.

Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and there's blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" I'm so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know i'm the hope for him"". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save people's life. What a mighty job it is!

In conclusion, i hope i can get this opportunity, this hospital have high opinion in VA, and there's more projects that can makes me learn. This is a rare chance for me and i have plenty of time during the summer brake.",0
"I do not approve to let people use any type of technology to read emotions. That is when it gets weird and people ask why are you feeling this way. This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary and we should be researching something better than this.               ",0
"What if everybody did have an after school activity? Would it technically be a good thing? I disagree with the principle. I think that requiring everybody to have an extra curricular would be too demanding. There are also more reasons why I disagree with the principle. I will be writing about the reasons that I disagree with the principle.

Some kids don'd do extra curricular activities because they have stuff home and family related. Some kids wouldn't have a ride back home from these activities. Now, I know that your thinking, ""Can't they ask their friends?"" But honestly, is there every friend for every person who doesn't have a ride? Why do you think there is a such thing as a taxi now? And some children, including myself, live farther away than most kids in their school. Not many parents are willing to drive far away for a child that isn't theirs. Also, there are some religions that do certain rituals on a daily basis, at certain times. Like prayers, or temple visits, etc: Some children just have a bed time. So not every one could make it to these activities.

A lot of children that do after school activities have homework and chores to do when they come home. There would be a less likely chance of these getting done, if everybody had an after school activity. Some kids struggle while they are at school, and they use their time at home to study and try to help gain their academic skills. If they are like me, a lot of kids can't really focus at school and usually finish projects and stuff of that sort at home. Some children just can't balance school and extra curricular activities and either stop doing the activity, or lack academically.

Along with the other things that I mentioned, some parents/guardians of the students can't afford the extra things that go along with doing these activities. For example: A lot of boys could play sports like basketball and football, but there are expenses to these things. You have to buy helmets, knee pads, shoulder pads, shoes, socks, food for games, and practice attire. Even things other than sports require paying something. Things like art supplies, musical instruments, money for costumes or outfits. There are some after school activities that don't require money, but most do. I have met a majority of kids' parents that just don't want to pay the money for the sport that their child wants to do.

These are some of the reasons that I disagree with the principle. They are valid and practical. I'm thinking about the many reasons why kids don't do after school activities and why it is important to understand these kinds of situations. I have met many kids who has wanted to do a sport, but can't because of a valid reason, like the ones I have listed. You have to take into consideration why everyone isn't doing an extra curricular activity now, and be satisfied with the ones that try and/or do.     ",0
"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality.",0
Yes i think it fair to say that because i think every student can make a B or a C to play any kind of sports that they want to play because if you have like a F or D you shouldn't beable to play you shouldn't beable to to play that game or something because it not fair to everyone that they cant play an the game but it is fair to the people who get F&D because they shouldn't be making bad grades they should be making good grades if they want to play an that sport it has nothing to do with ever body just you an principal an teacher why you get the grades you get maybe because it the way you acted an the way you play aronud..... And maybe the kids that want to play a sport cant play because of the way they behavior is or the way they talk to grew people......,0
"Home Schools

I agree students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the students will take their own time, is peaceful to attend classes from home, and got all the time you need. Is really good to watch a video at home or online to focus on one thing or another. Mostly people need to be home school because maybe they are a slow learner or they do not understand very well so need to take their time on one lesson. Some students want to attend classes from home because they do not feel as confidants at public school or they decide to be home and do what ever they want. Is a bad thing because not able to be successful at public school and not be as confidants.

Students can take their own time to attend classes from home because they can stop the lesson and then try to understand it every part they do not know or how to do it. Is really good to take their own time because mostly people need help to understand the lesson are telling you what to do. The students would not be as stressful because the teacher will not pressure you to know all these lesson to order understand. Student most problem is to stay on target because the student is having a difficulty time to understand it. It will make them feel more stressful as usual then going to public school.

The student will be peaceful to attend classes from home because the students will not be interfere any student or get distracted by other student. The student will get more focus on one lesson or another lesson to understand more information in one big information. It will help the student to stay on task and finish the assignment as quickly as possible. Students will get all the time they need to finish any assignment at home school because all of these taking assignment on online or video conferencing. The student will get relax as doing the classes from home and doing the assignment.

Mostly student will rather go to public school because they want to be not lonely and to communicate other people at school. Is mostly reason why they go to public school and need help to understand the lesson as much possible. Is depend on the student they want to go public school or to attend classes from home. Is not really a big deal to go either one of them is depend on the student will focus more then being at public school or attend classes from home. The public school have a lot activity to enjoy, but attend classes from school is no fun like not having activity to work with a group.

This is my reason to pick attend classes from school to order more focus, not get distracted, and have more time. Some people think is not a good to attend classes from school because people may think public is the best way to be friend one another and have more perspective. Is really not a big deal going to public school because have more friend to be on your side or to talk with them. It will help the student to be ready for anything they learn to attend classes from home. Is more better then taking classes from home then public school.       ",0
"Dear Principal,

I believe that you should not make us do community service. Yes, it is a good thing to do and will make you feel better about yourself, but if you make us do it then we really aren't wanting to do it ourselves. If you make everyone do it then the ones who already were, won't get the recognition that they deserve. They feel good doing it without being told to because of the fact that it's something they want to do. They feel good about it because they are the only ones doing it and that makes them an individual. If everyone has to do community service, it just becomes something that people are doing just because they have to, not because they want to and that's what they should really feel while doing it.

If nobody really wants to do community service then why would you make them. It's something that is supposed to be done by choice not by demand. It would be like telling someone that they have to go shopping when they don't want to. Getting told to do something that you like to do when you aren't told takes the fun out of it. If you tell them that they have to do something they are more than likely to ignore you and to protest.

Volunteering is a good thing to do but only if you are doing a good job at it. If you have to tell someone that they have to volunteer then they are just going to slack off and do the minimum that they have to just to get their hours done. As good as volunteering is, it's only something a certain type of person can do. If the person is patient, calm and caring, then they should do a great job at volunteering. However, if the person is rowdy, rude and selfish, then they aren't going to do anything to help the community.

Community service is something that needs to be done, but not by demand. Demanding something gets the person determined to do anything except what's being asked. While some people might actually take this demand as an excuse to really volunteer, others are using it as an excuse to goof off with their friends. Volunteering at a homeless shelter is a lot different then volunteering at a retirement home. A homeless shelter doesn't take patience or calmness, it only take a nice heart. A retirement home does take calmness, patience, and also a nice heart. People sometimes volunteer at the wrong places. People without any patience could volunteer at a retirement home and end up doing more wrong then good. People without any respect could volunteer at a homeless shelter and start making fun of them, and make rude comments.

Over all, making us do community service would be a bad decision because people wouldn't take it seriously and could end up doing more wrong then good. They will protest and ignore your demands. The people already doing community service will feel like they weren't getting any recognition doing what they have been doing. You should really pay more attention to the people who are doing the good things, then realizing that other people aren't. If they choose to volunteer, so be it. At least they will have a good application when going to colleges. They will be the people who get in for honestly helping people. The others who didn't do community service will have a not as good application to college and it will be their fault for not doing good when they could have. It's our choice whether or not we want to help people. Some of us will be the good guys, and some will be the bad guys. Either way, it's up to us to determine our future with what we do now. Not yours, not out parents, but us.

I think it would be a bad decision to make us do community service.",0
"Forced activitys doing more harm than good

Imagine bein a student you have homework, chores and if you have little siblings you might have to watch them. Your stressed, overworked and pressured to do better. It is time comsuming and you have little relaxation now with this new rule you have even more to do. Your being forced to take up a club. Keeping that in mind do you really think its good to force student to take up a club with all of their prexisting responsibillitys? If your not convinced think aout what kind of clubs you have. Do you think each student, each indivdual will like your limted choces?

Students have countless tasks with homework, chores and taking care of siblings. Students do not get much time for themselves. With so little time to relax they become overworked and stressed which is bad for productivity taking up a club gives them even less time to relax. Student grades can and probibly will sufer with this kind of change.

Although many schools have all sorts of diffrent clubs with such a wide and diverse student population it can be hard to please them all. No doubt you will have students whos intrests do not line up with the clubs you have makeing them to join a club they dislike insted. Imagine all of your clubs are sports related with socer, baseball, football, basketball, track, ect and you have a student who hates sports you can not make an exeption to the rule so what do you do? The only choice there can be is to make the student take up something they hate which can cause acting out from the student as they try to get out of the club.

Now some may argue saying schools have enough clubs to satisfy everyone. This may be true but I would imagine you have over one hundred students or even with just one hunded students you would be pushing the limit of how many students one techer can watch not to mention the teacher dose not get paid to watch students after school. They may also have children of their own they need to take care of. Another posible arguement is that a club builds confidence and I would agree but students could very well dislike being told to do an activity and if they dislike it alredy it will not end well.

Clubs are fun and enriching but should never be forced onto someone. Now I have given my side I pose the qusetion to you, do you still think its a good idea to force a club on students? My answer is no and I hope yours is the same. This rule is only going to do more harm than good.",0
"To start off I see electorcal college as a bad thing... Not for one reason For many reasons but the main one is that its unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Anther Reason is because canidates dont spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning. Abd there only fucosing only on tight races in the ""siwng"" states.

And plus its unfair, outdated, and last irrational...

Reason i say that is because it doesnt give no chance for us to find our right leader and to me you need to be fair with your voters and need to have the right president for your country. So he could do smart decisions for your people and state... And plus i disagree wuth this system because am in the democratic side of the hole system. And the Electorcal College is not democratic method of selecting a president that ought be overuled... In otherwords it is the electors that choose the president not the people. And to me theres no point of voting because if you cant oick what you want then whats the point of even trying to vote.

And your not voting for president your voting for the state of electors so they could choose the president for you... But the only thing positive thing that i see that each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee. But there are many rataining things about the Electrol College that you may not or may know about but i think i need to tell you... Its a lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. What am trying to say with this hole thing its that it doesnt fucos on the people as much as it should.

And the Electorcal College method of selecting the president may turn off alot of voters that are intrested in voting or taking place in our country, or just has no hope of carrying there state. For example Demorcrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. There votes will not be effected. Reason being because they have less incentive to pay attention to the compaign than most of them would have if the president were picked by the popular vote... But lets face it non voters swings in a national election, and in spite pf that, about one-half of the American population did vote in 2012 election. So if you think about it, it was only succesful during 2012 or maybe a little before that...

And another negative thing about the Electoral College with the Big states that might really get your attention is that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance so that means large states have lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decrease in the Constition.. For example the popular vote in Florida was very close.  Obama who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. So that means a victory for him... But the one good thing about it is that the larger states get more attention then the smaller states do.

Well to end this letter I want to say i disagree with keeping Electoral College and those were the reasons... Hope you get to read what i got to say and i Hope I make a change about this issue.                                                                                                                                            ",0
"Luke's point of view is that other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason is because you get to go to different places. Another reason is because Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with Katie.

You get to go to different places like Greece, and by time he got to Greece he was 18 years old that meant that he could draft for military service. Then he could see Europe and China. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept luke busy. They had to feed and water them two to three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with aunt Katie's farm as a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not the dangers at the sea. He had different jobs each time. The second time he was a watchman. And his job was to check the animals every hour.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It had opened the world to him. But he was greatful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of of people of other countries and their needs. And the awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That is why Luke's point of view for people to participate in the Seagoing Cow boys. And I think that it would be good for people to do what he did that way you get to go to different places that you may of not been to before. And that way you get to see what it's like on the sea taking care of all the animals and all of the jobs that you have to do.

It would be cool if people would do what Luke did that way you get a learning time where you get to see what it was like for Luke and do what he did I think that it would be cool I we did that. And If we did what he did I think that it would be fun takeing care of the animals and on a sea ride and going to different places that are in different countries to see what there life is like and how they eat and things like that would be cool.",0
"I am going to write an essay on why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it gives you a lot of opportunities to see different places.

You can go visit some of the most exciting places in the world.

Also if you like animals it gives an opportunity to take care of them.

If you have never gone over seas then there is your opportunity. You travel all over the world, go over the seas, and oceans. You get to adventure the seas, oceans, and the world. Also if you are a young Seagoing Cowboy and you still need to attend school the you can learn about the countries and seas by exploring them.

Like I said earlier if you still need to attend school you can learn different languages because you are exploring the world. So by learning diffenrent languages it can open up many opportunities for you. But it doesn't need to be all about learning. You can play games on the way and see many different sites that's the whole world would want to see. Then when you come back you can tell all your friends about the trips you have had. Then maybe they would like to come along with us.

In conclusion that is why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy to have those many adventures. ",0
"Self-Driving Cars are Amazing, But too Risky

I believe that self-driving cars would be pretty amazing technology. But when it comes down to it, how trustworthy are they? Considering the fact that you're leaving your safety to a computer. What problems could arise? A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen?

Your car could easily have a malfunction. Maybe the gps could take you to the wrong location and you're in a hurry. Maybe it could not drive how it's supposed to. It could go to the other side or the road or run off the road. A self-driving car could possibly cause crashes. This goes back with leaving your safety, your children's safety, your family's safety with a computer.

A self-driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car. These cars would have to all have built-in gps systems, sensors to know what's around them, and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield. Since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff, it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive. Extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand.

Who do you blame on a crash if it happens? Nobody will know for sure. Is it the other drivers fault or is it the maufacturer of the self-driving car's fault? These are all major if questions. Also, if you are injured in a crash, who will be around to call the ambulance if you're alone and unable to get to a phone? These cars just seem too dangerous and too risky to trust.

A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen? The idea seems great, but also scary. I do not believe these cars should be manufactured mostly because of safety issues. there are just too many to be able to trust the car.",0
"People ask for advice all the time. Other people's input can help us consider different possibilities before we make a decision. Based on what you like or dislike, you can make your decisions, but going on our thoughts alone can make decision making hard and stressful. One person's opinion can help us make decisions, but one person does't represent many different ideas. They can only give a few. When you have others opinions on something, then you can also consider those opinions when you go to make your decision. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is helpful because they can consider the ups and downs of a decision. Multiple opinions can also help us prepare for challenges, and give us a sense of finality when we make our decision that we have thought about it, and taken into account many different opinions.

When people make lasting decisions, knowing the consequences of that decision are important. When you talk to more than one person about making an important decision, you can get a clearer picture on how things will play out. An example would be if someone were going to steal something. If they asked multiple sources, then they would get multiple responses, like ""stealing is bad"" and ""if you get caught stealing, you might go to jail"" or ""stealing is good. You should try it"" . Depending on their motivation, and the advice they get the person could say ""i'm not going to steal"", because of all of the drawbacks. If that person had only asked one person, and that person had said ""stealing is good"", then the person considering stealing is in trouble, because if they make their decision with the advice that stealing is good not knowing the consequences, then they could get into legal trouble. If you only get one opinion on what we are trying to do, then we can sometimes get the wrong advice. Another example is if someone is trying to ask someone out on a date. If the person asks more people, they can get a better understanding of how that scenario will take place. With multiple opinions, you can consider the up: the person you ask out saying yes, or the down: The person you ask out saying no. When you way all of the different opinions like ""go for it, you have nothing to lose"" to ""don't do it, because she doesn't like you"", you can get a better understanding of what will happen in that moment, because you have opinions that help you. When you have more opinions on a decision, and you know the pros and cons, you can use that information to make good decisions.

When you ask multiple people for advice, there is a better chance of you making a better decision because you are armed not only with your own opinion, but with many others. Often, if there is a challenge that you face, having many people helping you will give you more of a chance to overcome the challenge. We see this in sports. I know this is true, because in hockey, when I make a bad play, I will talk to my coaches and ask what I could have done better in that moment, and I will also talk to my linemates. My coaches will tell me to skate the puck and drive the net, but my linemates will also give me details that I had not noticed while on the ice, like ""hey, I was open on the back door, try to hit me there and I'll have an easy tap in"". When I have these opinions in mind, the next time I am out on the ice, I try to implement what my friends and coaches told me. Not only does asking for others opinions make you a better sports player (if you play sports), but it makes you a better person, because you are asking people questions, making you a proactive person. The more input you get from people can help you to overcome a challenge whether in sports or in life.

A final reason why asking for multiple opinions is good is that it give you a sort of sense of finality about your decision. When you take the time to think about a decision, you have a lot of things to consider. If you go back to the stealing example, you have to consider different things. You might be stealing because you need to feed your family. Trying to make that decision on your own can be tough. When we take into consider the opinions of other people, we have help making that decisions, and once you make the decision, you feel a sense of completion. This is good, because you could stress out about making a decision, and now that it's over you don't have to stress anymore, because you made the decision and took into account everything that could have happened.

Asking more than one person for their opinion on a decision is good, because you can consider the pluses and minuses of that decision, you can prepare for a demanding time in your life, and once it's all over, you have a sense of completion, that you got it done, and now you can worry about other, more important things. When you ask for more opinions, you can overall get more things done, because you consider more possibilities in the same amount of time compared to just asking one person. When you get more opinions, you can make better decisions, and you become a better, more proactive person.",0

"25 years ago NASA discovered a face on Cydonia, Mars. It was extrodinary looking like an egyptian face! Many people think it was a human face that aliens created, but surely enough it isn't. As a scientist from NASA I know for sure it is definitely not. NASA went into further detail with this ""Face"". We looked further into the face just to show people that this is not a face created by aliens.

Further more we found it was just another Martian mesa, common in Cydonia. Since the face was becoming popular, being in movies, magazines, radio shows, and books we had to prove that we are right. As a result in 2001 NASA took a even closer and more clear picture of this face on Cydonia. It showed that it was just illusions making the mesa look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Making this mesa look like a face. This revealed to all people that this face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion NASA knows more than just typical average day people. NASA has proved us wrong from thinking it is a face created by aliens. This is just an illusional face as I would say. As a scientist I do wish that there is alien life on Mars, but as far as we know there is none. So the face on Mars is not a real face but just an illusion by natural land formation!",0
"Venus has many dangeres thing that could kill people and the auther explaings how it is still worth explaring it. It is really hot and has almost no air that we can breath. NASA is trying to figer a way that they can study venus without getting hurt.

He says that Venus could have been just like earth with life living on it. It has simmiler rock formashen, valleys, mountains, and craters such as earth does from where water used to be. It now has vary dangres atmosphere it is like 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater then it is on are planet. Venus almost has a 97 percent caedon dixide blankets, it has the hottes surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus has geology and wather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

NASA is working on possible solution to the hostile conditions of venus and they would allow scientists to float above the fray. It would be a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so milews above venuses landscapeing. It would be it by hovering over venus it would avoid all the unfriendly ground counditions, by staying up and out of their way. At 30 puls miles away it should be around 170 degrees fahrenheit and the air pressure would be close to that of a sea level on earth. Soler power would be good and the radiation would not exceed earth levels.

Even if we were able to have a ship hover over the planet we would be able to see much becouse most froms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. It is rendering standerdforms of photography and videography, reachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. NASA is working on other approaches to study venus like some electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested. Other way is looking at technology from the past like the mechanical computers, they were frist envisioned in the 1800s, it played an important role in the 1940s throw ww2. They calculation by using gears and levers and do not required electronics unlike modern computers that enormously poweful, flexible , and quick, but is more delicate when it come to extreme physical conditions.

Venus is a very dangers planet but is it alos a really intersing planet that can have really hight timpers and bad storms and earthquakes. NASA is hopefully going to find a way to inter the planet one day if they have to use silicon cardbide or older computers they will one day be able to explor Venus and see what it has in store for them.",0
"At first, the idea of not using a car may seem like an extreme inconvience that comes with endless problems. However after looking into the matter there are many hidden advantages. One can lessen emissions, and help create a less polluted environment for themselves. One may also be able to save money by simply taking alternate types of transportation.

By using a car less, one can help decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Paragraph five by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states that up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are due to passenger cars. While these numbers may seem daunting, some cities have reduced their pollution in simple ways. For example, Paris experienced record breaking air pollution caused by emissions. This drove leaders to put in place a ban on certain cars driving during specific days of the week. Not only did the smog clear within one day, but sixty percent of car traffic was down too. If parishes problem was fixed by making a simple switch, then less polluted cities could easily decrease their emissions swell.

One can also save money by avoiding cars. Not only are cars expensive in the first place, but as explained by Rosenthal in paragraph twenty nine, the bridge and tunnel tolls are rising. Bikes on the other hand, are a great alternative because they are inexpensive and they have free paths. One may argue that it is impossible to get the public to ditch their cars for human powered machines, but in Bogota, colombia, this is already happening. For one day each year cars are banned, and only certain types of vehicles are allowed. Selsky explains in paragraph twenty that millions participated, even on rainy days. Here one can see that this alternative transportation idea is not a couple of people, but a widespread movement.

Overall, lessening ones usage of cars has many benefits. Not only can one help ensure cleaner air, but they can save money while their at it. By making small changes in ones everyday life, huge impacts can be made on the community.",0
"Should students have the option to take online classes? Yes, I believe that students should have the opinion to take those online classes and that no one should take those classes away from those students. Students can be more active when they are at home then at school. You can pick a time to start your online classes and have a fixed schedule. It is important for students to have the education of there own way instead of worrying about how public/private schools are run.

Most students attend to focus more when they are taking online classes; For an example, Students dont have to worry about how teachers are teaching students when they are in a class full of other students. Students tend to struggle when teachers aren't teaching their students properly and care more about there monthly payments. Second example, is that having that one-on-one connection. Having that bond with your teachers are great ways to not be afraid to ask question when you dont get a problem or how to get the answers to the homework. Third example, most students tend to be antisocial at school because thats how they were born or even scared that people around them with judge the student and that the students wanna feel safe at school.

My second argument is that students tend to get bullied at school; Bullying is a huge thing around the world and that bullying is a serious problem; Bullying is the number one cause of student not attending to school and not getting the proper education they need: For an example, when the student is taking an online class, they dont have to worry about other students picking on him, but instead he can feel safe and really enjoy the education that he is learning online at home. There was this one time that one of my really close friends was being made fun of and picking on him everyday at school. He would sometimes not attend to school because he was too scared to come in to class and would always worry about the other students. He would not focus on his school work, but would mostly focus about protecting himself.

My Third argument is that students can ask question when they are having that one-on-one with the teacher. Students are afraid to ask a not so good questions in math, English, history, etc. Students have that nerve racking moment when a teacher tells the class if they have any questions. There was this one time that a teacher asked the class if there were any questions and none of the students raised their hands because I felt like everyone knew what they were doing in the class but me. I was having that moment that I didn't wanna waste the other students time about my question that I didn't understand on. It was the judgment that they would give me, but I know that it wasn't the case, people tend to over think about the problem inside the classrooms. For an example, Extroverts tend to not talk/socialized to people often, instead they don't talk to others and the problem that they are having trouble with and scared to ask the teacher because they feel insecure about talking or feel uncomfortable talking to others.

In conclusion, Students should have the option to take an online class and enjoy learning like everyone else should. Learning is a fun thing to do, but have different learning styles in life. The world keeps changing everyday now and new technology is developing overtime.",0
"Wham! Generic_Name hits the ground with a hard slam as everyone in the crowd is shocked at what just happened. In the moment Generic_Name thought to herself, ""why did I not listen to them, I should have listened to their advice to practice more instead of slaking off at practice."" Generic_Name her instructor, ran over to Generic_Name as fast as he could, and Generic_Name said to him when he reached her, ""I should have listened to everyones advice.""

The opinions of others can be very helpful in the future. Such as opinions of helping you with something you don't understand. The opinions from others are what shape our personality/lifestyle, this is because opinions are mostly statements of what we need to do correctly or what we need to improve on. For example a man is trying to get better at something but is having a difficult time grasping what he needs, but if someone who understands the skill shares their opinion of how they understood it easier, then the man will most likey have an easier time understanding the concept behind it, and if the man is still having trouble then he can just ask others until he finds a method that suits him. To sum it up the example stated above tells us that if you don't undestand how to do something then just ask and someone will in time help you.

Opinions can also can also change the way you view your lifestyle/everyday routine. Lets say someone finds you eating or drinking something unhealthy, so they decide to express their opinion about how you should properly take care of your body and not eat junkfood because it can lead to medical issues, you could ignore it or you could listen to the harm of what not taking care of your body can do. If you listened then you would most likely stop eating junkfood and find something more healthier to sooth your cravings, so you try to find something, but nothing came to mind, but that's when you remember you have an app that lets you see everyone's opinions in catagories. I don't know why you would go to so much trouble for not even trying peoples opinions on different foods or drinks that are healthy, so lets assume you do try them, so you later get into this habit of eating it so much it turns into a daily routine. Good for you you are now eating healthy food all the time because of other peoples opinions.

Another reason why you should listen to others opinions is because they can help with what you know and don't know. If you use snapchat, intagram, and facebook then you will most likely find an opinion in the first ten seconds that your in the app, this is because the app was designed to share someone's opinions with others. If you look on the app you probably find something new and interesting that could help you in the future whithout you even knowing that you got this skill from an opinion that was off of an app. These opinions are what give you knowledge, for example we started off as caveman but then someone came along and was like,""this is not good enough,"" and created a fire, then many other world changing opinions were expressed and that led us to this point in time now. To summerize it someone learned off of someone else and then that just kept happening millions of times and is still happening to this day with the ideas on how were going to put humans on Mars.

In conclusion opinions of others can help with many problems that you are facing, can help with living healthier and better, and opinions can even help you get smarter through someone else's mistakes.",0
"Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree with this quote for many reasons. If you're not doing something to help you get better, you'er failing, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life, and inactivity does not serve a purpose to this quote. Although, others may think different and disagree with this quote, other people in this world needs this motivation.

If you're not doing something to help you get better, you're failing. This role plays a huge part of others because failing is not a choice. You may fail a couple of times on this and that but what are you doing to not fail again? If something isn't right and want to fix it, do something about it.

In the other hand, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life. I play baseball for 10 years now and my goal is to make it to the big leagues but with this being my goal, I have to do something to help me achieve my goal. Success is not giving to you, you have to earn that success and by that, do something to help you succeed your dream.

At the end, inactivity does not serve a role in this act. Inactivity is getting in the way of you not achieving and succeeding. I take inactivity as a negative act because I dont want to be sitting at home or anywhere not doing something to help me get better. Be the one who changes your life by doing what it takes to do something in life to reach your highest goals.

Let this quote be a inspiration of achieving and succeeding in life or at anything. Be the one that can make a change. Doing something makes you accomplish more. It takes effort and hard work to do something but at the end, it all pays off. Only you can change yourself whether you want to be successful or not.",0
"When summer finally begins, the last thing a student even considers thinking about is anything that is school related. The infamous summer project stands to change that. This topic, the summer project, coupled with my predetermined ideologies to what summer should represent lead me to the conclusion that if summer projects are to be a requirement for students, they should be designed by the student, for the student. The reasons students should have the right to design their own projects include, but are not limited to, the fact that giving students a say would let them express, and learn about, themselves creatively, the fact that students can make something they are passionate about, and the idea that summer is not a time to be doing school work.

If students acquire the right to design their own summer projects, they would most likely make the project in a manner that would be both fun and educational at the same time. This is exactly what I did in the 10th grade, when I was assigned a video project in the class Driver's Education. I had never recorded a video for school purposes, and I never learned to edit either. The video project made learning to edit a necessity. I not only learned how to edit because of the video, but I also learned that making and editing videos can be extremely fun! It showed me that I love to make people laugh, and honestly, I may want to pursue making and editing videos one day. Students could choose a video project, or any other way to channel their creativity through this project. In doing so, in choosing how the project is designed, they may learn something new about themselves, and it gives students a chance to show, or maybe even find, their creative side.

By giving students the right to design their own summer projects, you are giving students the chance to make something with the passions they have. This would have an extremely positive effect, as they would now be working on the project with an unconventional mindset, at least in the context of school work. This change in their mindset would make it easier for the project to be done, as the unique things each student loves are being incorporated. This would also drastically increase the quality of work, as they are doing something they love. Allowing students to incorporate their passions would also show teachers how each student is unique in their own way. Student designed summer projects may also create a new interest for whatever topic the project is on, as students would be more inclined to make a cocktail of their interests and school-related topics rather than isolating the two.

Over the 10 months that make up the school year, students are in a constant state of stress, due in part by the work that they must do. Summer is a time for students to unwind, and to forget what it means to be a stressed out, overworked, and sleep deprived student. A time to relax. A time, for once in a student's life, to put the work, and the stress that comes with it, down for an extended period of time. If students are to be required to complete a summer project, they should, at the very least, have a choice in how they will design said project. As it will ease the sting of having to do school work in a time where no school work should be done in the first place. One may say, ""Anytime is a time to do school work!"" And while I see where they are coming from, school is out of session for a reason. Summer vacation is a time to be away from school and all of the psychological endeavors it brings with it. Which is why I know, definitively, that school work should not be issued out during the summer in the first place, and because of this, if school work is to be issued, the school, at the very least, should give the students the right to design their summer projects.

In conclusion, students, without a shadow of a doubt, should be given the right to design their summer projects. Through designing their summer projects, students can learn about who they are creatively, they can incorporate what they are passionate about into the summer project, and finally, students can feel better about having to do a project during the summer, as they will at least have a choice in what that project is. All of these benefits are extremely valuable, as they will have a positive effect towards a student's life, as they can learn new things about themselves, and show people a bit of who they are. These positive effects would be an impossibility if the flexibility that comes from giving students the right to design their summer projects is not given in the first place.              ",0
"Summer is long and made for students to relax. However, the school wants students to complete a project over the summer. The only problem is should it be teacher or student designed? While a lot of people would say teacher designed, it should really be student designed. This allows students to create a project that they're comfortable with presenting, and it shows the different learning capabilities from each student.

When students are given a project from a teacher they normally try their best even if they don't like the way it's set up. If students set up their own summer projects a lot of them would be more comfortable about how they publish them. It will bring the creativity out and the students will use their own talents to express how they work best. Furthermore, if students write in their own way it may be easier for them to explain their project. Then there's the confident boost, in which when an individual creates something that they enjoyed creating and seeing they'll be more confident to show it off.

Moreover, students all have different learning capabilities. Sadly not all teachers seem to realize this. If a teacher designed project was assigned, the teacher would expect to see the same project with something slightly different from the next. However, if the projects were student designed everyone's project would be completely different. Additionally that's why the project should be student designed rather than teacher designed because, the different ways people learn show their creativity output and can possibly even make them more prepared for a discussion or presentation of their project.

Finally, the chance at getting a student designed project would be much more expectant then a teacher designed project. The way students think nowadays is so relevant that most teachers don't realize that half of the aren't really understanding a topic, but just nodding their head and agreeing. Overall the summer projects should be student designed because,they allow a new way of learning for others, and they let kids show their true ability at being comfortable with a project they liked doing.",0
"In Germany, residetns have given up on cars. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"", except the main throughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge are only two places to park.

70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Some say they feel happier now than before when they had a car. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S.

In the new approach to make cities denser, and better for walking stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In teh U.S., the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legistors are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other tansport.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, an international news agency headquartered in London; 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

President Obama's goal to curb the U.S.'s greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week. Recent astudies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.    ",0
"Imagine living in a world where children were healthier and adults actually cooperated well. It almost seems perfect right? Well, this is what our society could look like in the future if students were required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should be obligated to be involved in at least one after school activity because the child would be healthier, more social, less stressed, and more disciplined.

Extra curricular activities, such as playing sports, can benefit the student's well being. The child would be kept in shape and would be more physically active. Keeping the child healthy could benefit him or her in the future by adding to the child's life span. Sports will also decrease the high obesity cases in our country. Obesity is a common issue in America due to the millions of fast food places and the limited exercise options. If the younger generations were forced to exercise, Americans would be more healthy and fit in the future. Students will not only be getting physically healthier, he or she will also become more mentally stable. Mental health is a common issue for children due to the excessive workload and pressure that school forces onto us; sports will provide an escape for the students. These are just a couple of the reasons why students should be obligated to be involved in at least one activity after school. The child will be healthier, happier, more mentally stable, and our obesity issues will decrease in our country.

Some might argue that the students will be overwhelmed with extra activities but I strongly disagree. After-school activities will provide an escape for the child from the real world. Activities such as a book club, yearbook club, and a sports team can all provide different environments for a student to go to when feeling stressed from school or his or her life at home. The student will also learn to have a better work ethic, as well as a better understanding of discipline and cooperation. The student would not get stressed from these activities because the child would be too focused on improving him or herself.

After-school activities will also help the child be more social. Being in different clubs or sports teams will expose the child to more social interactions, which can benefit his or her social life with friends and family. The student will also learn how to work better with other people in the community. This can help the community cooperate better and will improve the lives of many people. After-school activities will prevent the student from experiencing social isolation aside from school interactions with teachers or other students. He or she will learn to be a contributing member to the world. The student will be more disciplined which will help future work places run smoother. These are just a couple more reasons why students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. The child will be social, more of a team worker, and a better person in the society.

All in all, requiring students to be involved in any form of an after school activity can strongly benefit the student and society in the future. The students will be much healthier, more socially active, and the student will also develop a work ethic and learn self discipline. The society will also benefit from the involvement of students in extra activities because the child will grow up to be a cooperative and disciplined adult/ worker.",0
"Have you ever thought about why you ask multiple people for advice? For instance,you wanted to know how to play volleyball but you don't know how so you go,and ask one of your family members that played the sport,and turns out your mom played. She tells you to be yourself and don't be scared,and then tryouts came and you did what she said but it did not work so now your upset,but then you go ask the coach yourself and she give you the best advice. She tell you what you need to work on and how to serve good then you take her advice, and it works you have an better chance to make it on the volleyball team. When people ask for advice,they sometimes go to more then one person because they have a better chance,or they feel like it's bad advice,and they feel like it won't work.

First,I said the main reason why people ask more then one person is to make sure they have a better chance at achieving their goals. I say this because people who ask for advice they need help achieving a goal that they had in mind, but they can't do it because they feel like the advice that you given them is not going to work. So they try another person who they think can make their goals happen. I also said this because I was in the same situation as other people I had to tryout for cheer leading. I never knew how to cheer so I went home and asked my mom and sister because they were cheerleaders before, and I thought that if they were cheerleaders before then they can remember some of the things to get me on the team. I listen to them closely so I wouldn't mess up,but as soon as I got on the court and did the cheer the teacher said that it was good, but it wasn't good enough to get on the team after that I went home and cried because I thought that I did good ,but then I had and idea to go and ask the coach for some help and she did. She helped me so good that I actually made the team I was really happy and ever since I thought twice about who to ask for help.

However,this leads me to my next reason of why people ask more then one person for advice. It's because they feel like the advice is bad. The reason I say that is because people who know good advice between bad advice know what path to take, but for people who listen to the wrong advice it can take them down the wrong road. I say this because people who listen to bad advice will get themselves in trouble with many people. For example let's say that you go ask a person for some advice how to make money. They give you the advice,but the advice sounds wrong in so many ways,but you still take your chances and do what the person said to do,and then you get in trouble. Because you listened to somebody who wanted you to do their dirty work,and who knew you were going to get in trouble by the police. Now your in jail, and they are asking you who told you to this, but you remembered that you were not supposed to tell anybody the name of the person because you agreed online. That you would keep the person who gave you advice anonymous, and you didnt want to break another rule so you sat in silence until you realized what you actually did. Then you started talking turns out that person has a criminal record and you were now apart of his trial.

Therefor,this leads me to my last reason of why people ask more than one person for advice. it's because they don't believe that it will work. I think the reason why people think the advice won't work is because someone already told you something, and it didn't end well ,or you just had things happen to you where you tried everything but nothing seems to work out. This can actually happen to anyone who is always second guessing their selves. For instance say that I ask you for a little advice for my project and you tell me to do a electric car project but then I tell you that I don't have the right things for the project, and then you stop helping me because I complaining,but it's not my fault I was just trying to tell you that I need the materials for this and when we made it I got an F because it looked to easy and this why people are afraid of asking people for advice.

In conclusion people should always seek more options because some people will listen to advice that tells you to bad things, and some people would listen to anything at all. and they should also seek more options because it can actually get you somewhere if you think that your not getting any progress and also not all advice is bad for you just because it might sound bad does not mean that it is some people really want to help people who needs it. and this is why when people ask for advice,they sometimes talk to more than one person.",0
"Have you ever wanted to just go out and explore? Being able to see diiferent life would be an amazaing thing to see. Many people want to explore many things, whether it comes with risk or not. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" believes we should study Venus despite the dangers, snd I feel like we should, even though you don't know what is going to happen I feel like you should still take risk and explore, but there could also be more problems that come along.

In the article the author believes we should still go and explore Venus despite the risk that we could encounter. In the article it says, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" Astronomers know what the conditions are like on Venus but still continue to want to go and explore it. Also in the article it says, ""NASA's possible solution to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" They are making solutions to where scientists can go visit and explore Venus without having to deal with the extreme conditions.

The scientists are coming across more challenges than dealing with Venus' atmospere. In the article it says, ""However, peering at Venus for a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" With making up a solution to Venus' extreme conditions, there are now more problems that come across because of the solution that protects them from the major conditions.

In conclusion, scientist should go and study Venus disregaurding the major conditions. These scientist are very careful and aware of the risk of being on Venus, so they came up with a solution so they don't have to encounter the many harads. You should always go explore things you want to, but you should be aware of risk so you know what to do during the challenge of trying to explore somthing new.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that policy 1 is a great idea because most students sometimes get done with their work before others and sometimes they just have to sit there. By this I mean maybe it would be a good idea if we were allowed to have our phones with us. If this is possible we should keep them off during classes and other educational things we attend while we are at school. I think it would be a good idea if we could at least have our phones during free time or when we are done with all of our work as long as we don't bother others. It is also a good idea to have our phones with us in case there is some type of emergency while we are at school and maybe the power gets shut off or something. The reason i like this policy is because when we are all done with our work, going on field trips, or even just having free time we should be able to have them at least to text the people at our school or maybe if possible people at other schools as long as they are not texting while in class. They could wait until they are finished with all of their work and then text back when they're done. I also think we should have them at our lunch period too. I think this because maybe when we are old enough to drive or maybe our siblings or parents could pick us up to go out to lunch every once in a while as well. I really think we should not have our phones on at all or out when we are having a test because someone could text someone the answer to a question or maybe if the had a camera phone they could take a picture of their test and send it to them and that would get you in a lot of trouble. Mainly i think we should only have them out in our free time, when we are going on trips, when you have showed the teacher that you're done with your work, and at lunch. If you will can you please try to take this into consideration and just think about it and get back with me.

Sincerely,

"Dear Principal,

I highly encourage you to set the policy number 1 where you allow students to bring cell phones to school. I believe cell phones are necessary for young students because its a way to communicate with parents, friends and other people quickly and fairly easily. I believe outlawing cell phones in schools can be a safety issue to students who live fairly far from the school for the simple fact that they won't have any form of communication with their families. Also I believe allowing cell phones can now help a student academically.

With recent advances in technology we are able to do more with a cell phone than just talk and text message. With phones such as the IPhone, Blackberry and the Droid we are able to use phone applications to do everything from web-surfing to education. If cell phones are allowed in schools they can be used productively during class to distribute homework, notes and to do research for projects. Even if the cell phones can only be on during lunch or other free periods it can help students be more focused in school instead of wondering what new texts they got or trying to secretly text their parents during an emergency.

Though allowing cell phones to school can be highly beneficial, i believe the students should be reminded that it is a privilege not a right. I understand the saying ""give a man a inch and he'll try to take miles"" and I know when some students are given opportunities they try to ""push the envelope"" and try to over use the opportunity. I believe that if you allow the policy number one but a cell phone is out in class when it is not a true emergency, that the phone should be confiscated and given to the students parents. I also believe that constant offenders of that rule should be excluded from the policy and are forced to not bring their phone to school.

I believe cell phones are extremely important and passing the first policy in opposition to the second will can be beneficial to students, parents and even the school if they decide to take advantage of the opportunities given by this policy. This can make students morally happy and make them work harder opposed to the other policy which can upset students and decrease their production rate. This opportunity is golden and all we need is for you to put it in affect.",0
"Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, I am an eighth grade student, and I support your decision to enforce community service on young students. Community service is a great thing that should be encouraged. It can go from helping a fellow student with a tough assignment to cleaning up after a natural disaster, and can help many life's along the way. It doesn't even have to be hard, if you enjoy knowing you made a difference. It may even teach students a thing or two about life.

It can help teach a teen responsibilities and priorities. It can focus them on wanting to make a change for the better. Even if its just Picking up trash on the ground when outside, it makes that much less pollution and hazards to animal life. Not only that, but it can influence others to help someone in need or just to do what's right morally.

It could even be used as punishment to those who would rather disrupt a class than learn. It is very likely they wouldn't enjoy picking up someone's discarded food off campus, or somewhere else. It may even set a few straight and back, goal oriented. It would also help earn a good reputation for them and their school.

I believe it could help students for the better. Thank you for your time and please consider my words. I am happy I could share my opinion even if it doesn't make a difference.

"We live in the 21st century the century of technology. Cell phones are a detrimental part of today's modern society. As big of a deal a they may be they are creating a big problem in the united states. Texting and driving, and calling and driving. There are certain function and tools you can use to prevent this from happening. And a big fraction of accidents on the road are caused by cell phones. I will explain what we can do to keep this from happening.

The 21st century is definitely the century of technology. We have all of this new tech being invented. Electric cars, jetpacks, and including our cell phones. Cell phones have come a long way since they were invented in 1973. We used to only be able to use them in homes and businesses. But once they were mobilized society and the way we lived changed forever. That means that they could be taken anywhere and everywhere. This was only the start of something that was great and horrendous.

The problem that they were creating was called texting and driving. Texting and driving is a dangerous task. Its is so dangerous that in some states it is illegal to have a cell phone in your hand while you're driving a motorized vehicle. That is how much of a problem that texting and driving has caused. Same with calling and driving. They are both equally as dangerous when it comes to driving. Cell phones have caused numerous injuries and casualties. Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year. 1 of every 4 cars accidents are caused by using a cell phone while operating the motor vehicle.

What makes it worse is that nowadays we have tools and function built into our phones so we don't have to have them in our hands to use them. We now have bluetooth headphones so that we can answer calls without using our hands. We also now have handsfree modes that are built into our phones. Nowadays we really have no excuse to be hands on with our phones. There are a multitude of ways we can use them so we don't end up getting ourselves hurt in the process.

In all, choosing to text and drive or to not text and drive is purely a personal safety choice. Texting/Calling and driving while have the phone in your hand will forever be dangerous. Keep in mind the death caused by texting and driving and such. It is nothing to be toyed around with. Stay safe and put down the phone while driving. Or you will become one of the victims.   ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would just like to say that I think changing the policy is a bad idea for many reasons. One reason would be because, most students play sports to get things off their minds to make the grades they are. Plus taking things they enjoy away will just stress them out and make them mad of course you may still think this is a good solution but us children think differently. The people that play sports will find a way to one way or another. Lest they be heard they will revolt and take action. Also if many students have a C average then we would just not have very good and mighty teams you might as well take out all sports and just say we aren't going to have any sports but then if you did that I could almost ensure you that we would only have people at our school that could care less about sports which is very few. Now if you changed the policy where students with a C average could play then that would be efficient and reasonable because C is passing and I think everyone could agree with if you don't have a C average then you shouldn't play. Another reason why I don't agree is because we would have a lot more fights most scholars play sports to get their anger out and so that would just cause even more conflicts and then it would go to suspension and so on and so forth. I really hope you understand what I am trying to say and take my advice into deep consideration then maybe our school will be more successful.

Sincerely,

"Imagen no longer having to sit though a boring online lecture, being able to find the lecture helpful and not a drag or a bother. Well with technologies like Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS or Facial Action Coding System, that is quite possible. With a technology that is able to read and recognise facial expressions, it can help improve students online lectures and help them pay attention and focus. A technoloy like FACS that can read emotions through facial msucle movment would provide the education system with a better way to connect to the students and aid in their emotional focus to the lectures and assignments providing a valuable aid to student education.

Even though humans can already perform similar actions, being able to tell what those around you are feeling by looking at their face. Humans can only ""calculate"" how such individuals are feeling and many fail to get a appropriate calculation. As Dr. Huang notes, "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" so for a computer to be able to read nonverbal expressions is very helpful as most students are kept to themselves. A computer with the FACS tecnonly would be able to recongize a studetns needs when learning on line. As Dr. Huang states, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored [allowing the computer] to modity the lesson."" This ability to recognize emotions through facial movment can help improve the students performance by modifying lessosn to meet their educational needs. As some students already have trouble focusing in class and loose attetnion when lessons are boring or they just simply don't understand. Technologies like FACS provide the students with an adaptive and responsive system that will help them improve their focus and learn more affectively.

On the other hand some people may argue that technologies like FACS are an invasion of privacy. Or that these technologies can not really tell your emotions. These technologie dont do anything millions and millions of people do not already do everyday, read facial expression. The is what tecnologies like FACS do they read and recognize facial movments to determine emotion. Just like all of us do when trying to figure out the feelings of those around us. These techonlogies use a complex level of facial recognition invented and tested by proffesionals like Dr. Huang. As well as Dr. Paul Eckman who studies anatomatical movments and sturcutres. Being able to classify six basic emotions those being, "" happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". Even though these six can not analyzse every single emotion it will analyzse the one expressed the most.

Allowing those around, like teachers and instructures to aid in figuring out what is wrong with an individual and how to help them perform better.

So overall technologies like FACS which are able to read facial muslce movments are benefitail to student learing. A technoloy capable of adapting to analysed human emotion will help studnets learn , focus and feel more attented to in their learning. By identifying the emotion these technologies can also help teachers and guidecne counselors work towards aiding those students which are emotinally depressed and need help but wont verbally say it. Such technologies not only offer a way to aid and improve student attention in learning but also help those students who hide their emotional prolems, which affect their learning by having teacehrs and counselors provide that help thanks to technologies that can read emotional expressiosn ",0
"I disagree with the principles decision to force the kids to participate in extracurricular activities because, First some kids might not have time for the activities, secondly some kids have non school related activities, and lastly some kids may not like the activities they get to choose from. Generic_Name came home crying thinking about what the principal said in the assembly,""The teachers and I have come to the decision that everyone must participate in at least one extracurricular activity starting in two weeks."" ""I cant do that!"", Generic_Name said crying on his bed. ""I have travel soccer, and if I miss practice I'll get kicked from the team."" Generic_Name put his hands over his face and said,""what am I going to do?"" ""I need to tell the principal that he cant make kids participate in school related activities."" So Generic_Name sat down and started to wright.

Dear Principal Generic_Name, I got three reasons why you shouldnt force kids to do extracurricular activities. The first being some kids dont have time for the activity chosen, or given to them. For example, If you have a little sibling and your parents work late hours you have got to be there to take care of them. My friend is a good example of this because his parents always have late work hours, and so he needs to take care of his three sisters, But he cant do that if you make him do an extracurricular activity. My second example of this is my friend Generic_Name. He has very stricked parents and they dont allow him to stay at school past 3:45, and if he does he gets in big trouble.

The second reason being some kids have non school related activities. A lot of kids I know have sports after school and sometimes its there only fun of the day. Im a good example of that because, I have travel soccer after school and sometimes soccer is my escape from the teenage world. Another good example is my best friend Generic_Name. He plays travel hockey, and if he misses a certain amount of practices he will get kicked off the team and that will break his heart, so do you really want to be the one that breaks all thees kids hearts?

The theerd and final reason being that some kids may not like the activities that they have to choose from. For example a kid I know only likes the sport fencing, But unforchanetly the school doesnt provide that activity, so he will have to go and do another sport that he wont enjoy. The last example is a kid i know that doesnt even like sports. for instance she is not athletic, and she cant throw or ketch a ball, so she would be miserable in the activity shes in. To add on to this I saw her face after the assembly, she looked like she was about to cry. The point of me writing this is so people dont come to school and see all of the sad faces, and the last thing we want is a bad reputation of this great school.

Two days after Generic_Name turning in his essay he was called in to the principles office. ""Generic_Name!"", Mr Generic_Name said in a hard voice. ""You make a good point in this essay."" ""Really?""Generic_Name, said in a surprised tone. ""Indeed, I havent read an essay this good in a long time."" ""Im going to make a special announcement this morning about this, so make sure you are listing, OK?"" ""Yes seer"", Generic_Name said with a big grin on his face, and went off to class. Wail Generic_Name was in class talking about what just happened the announcements came on. ""Good morning everyone, I have a special announcement today."" ""I had a kid this morning come to me and widen my eyes about my decision at the assembly, and because of him I have changed my decision, so you dont need to participate in extracurricular activities if you choose not to."" ""Thank you Generic_Name, thank you."" The hole school lit up in joy, and as the day came to an end,Generic_Name held his head up high and walked to his mom's car.        ",0
"Technology is a wonderful thing that keeps growning and changing. Many people have different views on technology. Some people think technology is a great help to our daily lives such as computers, cell phones, and cars. However, there are many other people who would strongly disagree and say technology is ruining us. Either way you can stop technology from growing and becoming part of us.

Technology has advanced our cars in many ways. Many new things have been created such as electric cars, environmentally friendly cars, and now we are seeing driverless cars being created.

There are many positive aspects to having driverless cars. With the improvements in software cars can now handle more driving tasks on their own. These cars can steer, navigate, and brake themselves. They also notify a driver when the road requires human skills. When the vehicle is in danger of backing into someone the seats can vibrate to alert the driver. Some people just do not see the point of having a driverless car when you still have to help the cars in certain situations, but I think they are a great way to keep us safe annd focused. All of these aspects are examples of how the car can keep you safe and eventually lead to less accidents.

Transportation is a very important part of our daily lives. With the driverless car transportaion is becoming safer and easier. Drivers will be more alert and focused. This will decrease the amount of accidents caused by careless driving. In conclusion, I think driveless cars are a great addition to technology and transportation.                           ",0
"Many students use their summer vacation as a time to relax and forget the stress of school. In doing so, many of them come back to school only to find that they have forgotten a good amount of what they had learned the previous year. Teachers have found that a good way that they can overcome this problem is by assigning projects for students to complete over their vacation. However, the way in which these projects are designed could either accomplish that goal or make students dread returning to school even more. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it allows students to showcase their creativity, fosters leadership skills, and ensures that students are interested in what they are learning.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to showcase their creativity. By allowing students to choose their own project and design it however they see fit, students will be opened up to a whole new spectrum of ideas to explore. Instead of being stuck doing the same old PowerPoint or essay, students can come up with something new that not only is fun to make, but is fun for the class to watch. Earlier this year I was assigned to do a project in which we had to create a PowerPoint on a scientist. By the time the class had watched two PowerPoints, we found ourselves bored and no longer paying attention. Every project was the same thing with a different name tacked onto it. Later in the year we were allowed to do a project in which we could create any form of visual media that we wanted. Come presentation day, we found ourselves excited to showcase the creative videos and songs we had made.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it fosters leadership skills in students. When students are assigned projects by their teachers it puts them in a routine in which they only stick to the instructions that were assigned. If students were instead allowed to come up with a project on their own, they would be taught how to explore outside of a set of rules and create something themselves. I was always a shy person growing up, and loved when I would be given a set of rules that I could follow and not have to stray from. However, once I was given the opportunity to create a project myself to present to the class at the end of the year, I found myself start to break out of the shell I had created for myself. Being allowed to design my own project gave me a way to do things according to my own rules instead of those set by others and learn what it meant to be in charge of what I was doing.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be interested in what they are learning. When students are given the opportunity to choose a project for themselves, they will find themselves more invested in their work. My biology class once was assigned a project in which we had to find some way to tell the story of DNA. After completing the projects, we would be given a test on it. Our class found that, after completing the projects in the way that we wanted to, we were actually more interested in learning how everything worked. It was no surprise that our class got the highest grade average on that test.

Some may argue that allowing students to chose their own projects might result in projects that are sub par, or not up to the standards that the teachers are looking for. However, simply revising the idea with the teacher before starting the project would easily help in overcoming this problem. When students are allowed to tap into their creativity and come up with their own projects, teachers are helping students learn to express themselves and stand out from others. When we allow students to discover who they are, we are teaching them more than a teacher-designed project ever could. ",0
"There are many different emotions that people obtain each and every day. There have been many studies about different emotions of people and how the emotions are recongnized. The defintion of emotion is the way a person expresses themselves through body language. I believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becuase it will advance the teachers, the students will portray better attitudes, and it will benefit the school's decisions.

First, the teachers skills will advance with this technology. While teaching, the teacher will find out which material the kids are interested in. The text states,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Kids in school usually do not communicate how they feel to their teachers. This is one of the biggest problems with school. If there is an ability to change for the better, why not take it?

Next, during school, kids will portray stronger attitudes. There are two scenarios when speaking about how kids would act in school if this technology was available. The students would either give out a better attitude, or fake it until they make it. Students do not want their teacher to know how they are feeling. In the article, it states,""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" Therefore, the teacher has a strong idea of how a student feels. Unless, of course, the students are faking it.

Finally, this technology would benefit the schools decisions. The school would have the ability to study each student's emotions and find out how the student enjoys to learn. Better yet, the school will know which classes to place the student in based on his emotions toward different subjects, this is a very easy way to find out a pathway into a student's future. The article says,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent feaarful, and 2 percent angry."" The quote is referring to the famous Mona Lisa artwork. However, if a school had access to all of that information about a student, they could make the student's career path excellent.

There are a ton of benefits to the innovation including advancing a teacher's skills, skyrocketing the happiness of students, and the overall decision making process that the school goes through. Many years ago, no one could ever imagine that this technology would come into existence. The techonology of this world is advancing and changing rapidly. No one has time to even blink.",0
"Do you really think that there is alien life? The picture shown is land on Mars. NASA said that it was a shadow giving a ""illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" NASA studied the image to make sure they were correct of what they saw. People who believe in alien life base their statements upon opinions.

NASA even said it was ""a natural land form. There was no alien monument."" Something that big would have to be a piece of land. This was just a large mound on mars. The people who think it is a alien or a alien artifact think that NASA would hide this from the public while NASA says they wish there was a ancient alien civilation on Mars. What NASA is saying is that they would want people to see this and wish that it was a alien.

This image has nothing to do with alien life and just made a illusion of a face. NASA is not lying and double checked to make sure what they were seeing was certain. This is just land on mars and a picture taken at just the right angel and time to make that look like a alien. So now that I've told you the facts do you believe me? ",0
"In today's society, when people are asked if they would give up their cars, they would be shocked. No would be the most common answer. However, the advantages of limiting car usage are great. General stress decreases, and polution to the environment also decreases. People are not only helping themselves, but also helping the ecosystem.

Stress. Everyone has it; but what if it could be decreased just by using personal transportation less? In Germany, there are certain communities that ban car usage. No cars are allowed inside the city. Street parking, driveways, and home garages have become obsolete. One citizen of one of the towns said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

In German Suburbs

). The anxiety one gets when driving a car is almost unreal. Most kids 16 and up now just do not get their licenses just because the thought of driving scares them. Citizens of cities that have just one day where cares are prohibited, such as Bogota, Colombia, love that singular day out of the year. Most say its a good opportunity to increase mental health (

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota)

. Stress not only is awful for mental health, but also physical. 75% of those who have high levels of anxiety, or are exposed to it, are tired all the time, often feel weak, or sometimes may even cause heart issues. The number one reason people have stress is by driving. So using cars less is the best way to decrease stress, and promote good mental health.

Most people that read or watch the news know that the environment is hurt, and that the human population is at fault. How? Excess usage of motor vehicles. As stated in

In German suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. These statistics are horrible. Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of near-recorcd pollution rates (

Paris bans driving due to smog

) Not only was nature being hurt, but the population of France. Breathing in smog is unnatural. Thehuman body can not take that many polutants, and so it tries to fix itself. In doing this, lung cancer rates rise, pnumonia rates rise, diseases in general become more abundant. Paris took action. When enforcing the driving ban, congestion was down 60% in just five days. The only partial solution to this rising amount of smog is to decrease driving rates, and to use deisel gas less. I hate this test so much why am I even writing this I feel like a robot just going through the motions and its your fault. I blame you.

Rome was not built in a day, so getting state legislatiors or even government officials to agree on a partial driving rule may take a while. However, citizens can spread the word of the evils of driving. You, dear reader, can fix this problem. Try carpooling to work, riding your bike to places near you instead of driving. Do what you can to reduce polution and stress. Influence your friends and family to do the same. Together, we can rase awareness of the evils of driving. Together, we can rule the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ",0
"Every student's dream is to be successful, happy, and healthy in life. One thing that can help people achieve this goal is by taking a part in an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, debating, getting work done, or just hanging out, students can gain experiences that can guide them in the path of life. Just by partaking in one after school session, new life lessons can be learned, and things like social skills, core virtues, and new work ethics can be absorbed and applied to daily lives. With that being said, extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students in many ways, including introducing new hobbies, helping to build friendships, and pushing students out of their comfort zones.

Hobbies start out as small things that people do for fun. As time passes, that hobby can become a part of people's daily lives. They constantly use what is learned from those experiences and apply it to other things. It is very useful in so many ways, but some people either choose not to show their talents, or don't know where to start. By committing to an extracurricular activity, people can explore many different genres of platforms that they can express their skills on. By being able to express their talents, their stress levels can make a steady decrease, and they can focus on the things that make them happy.

Some people can make new friends very easily, but unfortunately, some people are not blessed with that talent. Through extracurricular activities, anyone can find people who have similar interests as they do, where as that can be hard to find in a big places, like new schools or churches. By joining clubs and other programs, people can have fun with other people that they normally would not think to be friends with. For example, a couple of kids that enjoy playing soccer in their free time want to join a soccer club. They attend an interest meeting after school and meet lots of other boys that share the same interest in soccer as they do. When they go to the first practice session, they see all their new friends and have lots of fun with them. In addition to making new friends and hanging out with them during the after school session, the new friends can greet each other in the hall and introduce them to friends that don't go to the soccer club. There are many other instances where something like this could happen, so joining an extracurricular program is very much recommended.

Although it may seem scary, pushing students out of their comfort zones is a very effective work ethic used by parents and teachers that want their children to succeed. By doing this, teens are more likely to acquire good results, no matter what it is that they are trying to succeed in. If a child is pushed to commit to an extracurricular activity, they will not only see how fun it can be, but they can also see how it can help them get further in life. Extracurricular activities are designed to not only help students find what they are interested in, but they help students that are having a hard time. They are suited for people that aren't able to go to other places to join clubs and people that have schedules that are not suited for other places. Extracurricular activities can ensure a safe, fun place that provides a place for students to express their creativity.

In some ways, extracurricular activities can be intimidating to people that are scared to go out and meet new people. Nevertheless, extracurricular activities can help people explore new passions, make new friends, and be pushed to always try their best whenever and wherever. If people have a hard time finding out what after school activities they should participate in, they should always go to their counselor for help or talk to another trusted adult. At the end of the day, extracurricular activities are a fun alternative to going other places that will always there to benefit you and guide you to a sure success.         ",0
"Would a computer that can read you emotions be good for the class room? Facial Action Coding System allows technology to identify human emotions. Therefore it can tell weather someone is happy or sad. The machine can also tell if you are feeling mixed emotions by the muscle movement in your face.

""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang ptrdicts. 'then it could modify the lesson, like an efffective human instructor"" (paragraph 6 ""making mona lisa smile""). If the FACS systems was downloaded into the computers at school then students would learn better because the computer would know the best way to teach them based on there emotions. Second ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. huang. 'so computers need to understand that, too.""(paragraph 6 ""making mona lisa smile""). Since people can't always tell the emotions of another person in the class room or if a teacher can't tell if there students are understanding the contect they are teaching then the FACS would fix this because they would be able to tell if the student understands or still doesnt undersatnd the content being tought to him or her.

"I think that students will benefit from being able to attend classes online.

The reason i support this question is because some student are not able, to attend school during the day or night time for example; in others country or this can happen in any country, Some students have to work all day for pay bills or help there family buy food, clothes, etc. or they live alone with brothers and sisters and is difficult for them to have a education because they have to work for take care of there family.

Sometimes student have to go out of town or flight to others country and they have to get out of school for days or months and that is the bad thing about that because, if you mess a lot of day you can fail you classes or don't graduate on time. The good thing about online classes is that after work or when you have free time you can go online and do your work or video conference with the person you taking you classes.

Things about the online classes is that, if you can't go to school you can take it at home or any place you want, they only thing you have to got is a computer or phone internet or you can go to a public library and also if you are taking the video conference class you need a computer with camera that's all. For that i think that school that got online classes or video conference classes can help a lot of student to graduate and have a better future, or better life and they can work and help there family at the same time.

Also for adult if they don't finish school at time they can take oline classes, also if you graduated from school you can take a carrier online, and is not necesary to attend to college you can work in whatever you working and study online the classes, online is the best way for people that can not attend to school or people that work all day or travel always to study and got a GED",0
"Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to do some community service. We all have to live in this town together so why don't we all take part in keeping it clean and a nice place to live. Community service is not just to keep things clean, but it is also to help people live a better and healthier life.

Some people don't think community service is worth the time, but those people have never taken the time to try it. They don't know the satisfaction you get when you see the smile on a person's face for doing the right thing. People always thank you and most of all you know inside that you did the right thing and that fills an emptiness inside.

Sometimes community service can be fun. If you happen to do something that you are interested in. Like maybe if you're into sports you could clean up your local sports complex. And create a better more fun facility for everyone.

Everyone that i know that has done any community service say they like it. They don't mind taking the time to do something good for someone else. Doing community service is also for your benefit, by keeping you up and active. It gives you something to do, rather than sitting at home on the coach being lazy eating potato chips and playing video games.

So I think that it would be a good idea for you to have everyone do some kind of service to help the community. So please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time and i hope this letter helps your decision.

"Have you ever wondered about how another planet can be just like earth and how its terrain is well researchers have found out that venus can have the exact same terrain and other features to it as well.

Venus often referred as earth's twin has the same density and size and it is the closest to our planet as well. While researchers try to land a spacecraft on the surface of venus it is almost impossible to because the temperatures on venus are an average of 800 degrees farenhite. The pressure is 90 times more than what we experience on our own planet so we would be crushed if we stay there. Thats only the beginning of what goes on there, there is erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking on its surface. But even after that it is just like our planet earth because scientist have been looking at venus and found that venus has a surface of rocky sediment and othr features like valleys, mountains, and craters. They have also found out that there use to be covered in largely oceans and also could've supported various forms of life.

The conclusion to all this is that even though venus is dangerous and also good at the same time that we can still explore it and possibly have human life living there.",0
"Many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use to the public. There comes some great advantages when doing this. You can help limit greenhouse gases, relieve the stress from cars, and become less dependent on your car for transportation.

The big advantage about limiting cars is to help prevent the rapid spread of greenhouse gases the creates smog in cities. From source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions polluting cities even more. With these dangerous gases in the air, the world is in great danger of becoming unhealthy and we are to blame for this awful cause because of the over use of cars. By limiting the use of cars you limit the amount of pollution in the air.

By limiting car use an finding other means of transpotation, you can actually relieve stress put on you from the constant beeping and noises made by cars. By walking or riding a bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds of the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good to you and the environment. Some people, as seen in source three, have taken this experience of the limiting of cars to share the experience with thier companion riding a two-seated bike. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

By limiting the use of cars you begin to be less depended on cars. By this happening you learn your life will know longer be circled around your car and you begin to see that driving a car everyday is not really needed. By using public transportation of car-pooling you greatly decrease the amount of pollution in the air while also having a ride to work or where ever you need to be.

Limiting cars can have multipal advantages to it. You can help stop half of the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars, relieve stress, and become less dependent for the need a car. This will cause you to become a better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds of generations to come.                ",0
"Although you may think of your car as a necessity, there are many advantages to not being behind the wheel. Greenhouse gas emissions would decrease and promote alternative transportation are among those many.

As the majority of people learned in grade school, greenhouse gases aren't such a great thing and are even destroying the planet. Stepping away from your car could decrease the amount of these deadly gases we put into our atmosphere. in the first article Rosenthal says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe, and up to 50 in some carintensive areas in the United States."" If the output is really that high and we stop using cars as much imagine the impact it could have if this happened world wide. in the second article Duffer was talking about how Paris had to ban cars because the smog, an effect of greenhouse gases, was too thick. towards the end he said that a few days of the car ban reduced the amount enough to where they could lift the ban. the smog was said to rival China's, and you see that on the news constantly so if only a few days made it significantly better then why can't we try it out?

Promoting alternative transportation could help local economies rise, and lower stress levels. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" sais a business man participating in boat's carfree day. Participants in these events claim that they relieve stress and most people can see why, it's very hard to avoid stressful situations when you're driving. Whether it's the guy who cut you off or a slow old lady there is always something that will grind your gears. the executive chairman of the Ford company said that ""in cities where vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable they would be able to create a network that would save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" If there are other sources of transportation available, why not take advantage of them?

Lowering our usage of cars we could keep our planet in good condition by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases and promoting alternative forms of transportation which has benifits within itself. If there are other options the only problem I see is that you can't pick what radio station is on.",0
"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want.",0
"The face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. The ""Face on Mars"" has became a pop icon, it has starrd in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocerys tore checkout lines for 25 years. Its the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. "" It reminds me the morst of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

When,

NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the caption noted a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

Though, When Mars Global Surveryor flew over the Cydonia for the first time, Michael and his Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all

For example: As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see where they were."" The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

Although, some people people think it was created by aliens or that few scientists believe the face was an alien artifact, but actually its just a natural landforms common around the American West.               ",0
"Hello my name is Luke I think you guys should join the program because its fun you can even join when you are out of high school. A man came up to me at one of my jobs and asked if I wanted to do it so I had to say yes because I knew it would be fun to do. You also get to travel places with the other cowboys. We do this to help the countries in Europe that got destroyed in World War II recover. We help them get thier animals food supplies.

44 other nations helped us and all together. we made something called UNRRA that stands for United Nations Relief and Rehibitation Administation. Thats were I come in the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses and cattle and mules so me and Don signed up. If you turn 18 when you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can be drafted to the military services but they might tell you to keep doing the Seagoing Cowboy for a service. I even got to see Europe, China, Greece, Italy and more.

It made me aware on other countries and their needs. It was also fun to be on board. I got to play table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that passed time. I think you should join to and do all of the fun things I did. You will learn a lot of things. You will aslo learn about other people and not thinkig about yourself.",0
"the author that evaluates how well the author supports the idea that studying venus is a worth pursuit despite the danger. by saying "" nasa is working on other approaches to studying venus for example some simplified electronis made of silicoin carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating"".

This evidence support my claim because the people are studying for big things like how well studying venus is a worthy persuit.

Another claim that evalutes how well the author supports the idea that studying venus is a worth pursuit despite. In paragraph 8 it says"" striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has vaule. Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself.

which exsplain that studying venus is a worth pursuit despite.

The conclusion I have about "" the challenge of exploring venus "" was . It seem like if u study it its a good thing . because its very important to nasa it says that in the reading . so maybe if u do it you would be succesful.      ",0
"I believe technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. The reasons are,they buy thing online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for them.

Purchasing online things are not always great. When you do purchase it online sometimes they don't always tell the truth and when your getting phones or other things like clothes or makeup. These thing you never know if its used or brokering and if someone could of warn it too. Also food that are buy online are not fresh and they could Carey germs. Take for example when you go out you look at the food to see, which one is good and which one is bad but when your online you can't tell what your getting. This cause people to become lazy.

People become lazy because of how much stuff there is on online and games,

TV shows. Therefore people rather watch a TV show then go out with there family. This is bad for people because this can cause people to become depressed,more stress about online chats and what there saying online or watching a TV show;but you wish you could be that person. People will stop going outside. Take for example YouTube, YouTube is the most used media but also there are non-stopped videos they can go on forever and people stared to thing they have to many things to do. This cause peoples communicant with others harder. YouTube cause people to give up.

Communicating is becoming harder for people because they don't face to face talk anymore. Now they use phones more. Phones are used for texts ,calling. So why is communicant important? Communicant is the main thing in your life it brings people together and you need it for jobs. Jobs where you have to work with other people and help people that buy from you. Take for example Generic_Name is the co work and Generic_Name is the costumer,Generic_Name does't talk to people that much because she texts more ,therefore, when Generic_Name came up to her ask for help. She didn't help because she doesnt like talking to people.

Therefore,technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. I believe these are the reason,they buy things online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for people. Peoples need to use less technology and try to open there self to the outside world and hang with there friends and family or read books. Some will still choose to use technology today.",0
"my suggestion would be you are allowed to use the cell phones in school because it would be better cause it gets boring in school and we be able to have are phone on us all times and on cause really what if there was something wrong to your family you might want to know. and again we could use them in the halls and things like that and we don't have to get in trouble for having on cause everyone knows everyone brings a phone into school and you get in trouble and your mom has to come in the school and get it from a the teacher and that's a little regulus.

It would be a good idea for phones to be allowed phones in free time and lunch and not class cause it would distracted you in class. I think we might be able just to text because if you distracted kids you will be in trouble and it want be a distraction if we all text and put it on vibrate so no one can hear the phone but just see it being use and don't have to hear any body's voice or anything.

It would help the teachers waste there time busting kid for phones in there pockets or kids texting under neath the desk trying to cover it the want have to waste there times after school for just a phone but one they have a and the text and if they get to use there phones we get to its not fare leasing to there phones going off in class. all so its a waste of the schools time just for having that as a rule no phones in school its point less cause you know and we know that your are not going to stop us for bring are phone to school.

so regardless if you still don't want us to have phones in school we are going to everyday all day until schools over so u can let us not have phones in school or u can think about wasting all the teachers times or let us bring are phones to school. they might just want to worry about kids and there studies and not care for a phones and care about all the fighting and all the kids making front of each other.",0
"Have you ever sat in your room and looked at the ceiling for a while and you see a weird shape or face? If you haven't have you ever stared into space and seen a shape or face? Do you think of how it got there, from an alien, your imagination, or natural landform? My guess would be natural landform.

I am saying natural landform because alians aren't real, and if they were why would they create a human face. Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know. What was the point of going to Mars no one lives on Mars we live on Earth.

The is a 50/50 chance that it could be your imagination, just like if you were staring out of space or looking up at the ceiling and see a random shape or face, that is your imagination, so it could be you imagination. But the scientist wasn't really focused on this ""face"" they just happened to look over an see it otherwise just like if it was your imagination you would be very focused on to something and happen to see it.

It is a natural landform because when Mars came about this ""face"" was made along with it no one else put it their it naturaly came along. You can believe that it was put their by an alien but by the evidence and how I proved it you might think that it natural landform.",0
"Most of the people in the world forget the things they learned after a long period of time. In the summer students dont worry about school, classwork, and homework. They are worried about havng fun outside of school. The students go all day and all night for the whole summer forgeting about school. Until teachers started designing summer projects. Teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because it will help students understand the information in the summer time, not forget the information, and be more and be more responsible.

Students should come back to school understanding the information. If the information has to be retaught then thats taking away what new information your learning or how much information you could have learned. If students were to make their own summer projects, they would have made it no challenge. Made it as to where they could be finished in a day. A teacher would put some information they dont know or need to work on so it is a little bit of a challenge. During the summer, if students dont do their projects made but their teacher they will not understand or retain the information.

Summer time is the time to relax and have fun. Just because you are out of school doesnt mean you stop learning new school topics. When your teacher makes a project they are putting in all the information they feel like you need to work more on and all the things you need to keep practicing in order to remember that information. Say for example a student named Generic_Name makes the project prompt for theirselves, then Generic_Name doesnt remember everything that they worked on from the beginning of the year to the end. So she puts in all the information that she knows then next year when she comes back, her new teacher asks her about something that she didnt put on her project and she doesnt know it.

Projects are fun ways to learn new material. Teachers give out projects expecting you to return them done to the best of your ability. A project you made will just make you become lazy and just make you wait until the last minute to do it. Summer projects made by the teacher will show so much responsibility on your behalf because teacher make projects and work to help you gain on your struggles. You taking the time out of your day to sit and do your work without someone telling you, knowing that you dont have to do it shows great reponsibility. From this you will build great habbits and the next year of school you wil be the most responsible person at the school.

In conclution, summer projects should be designed by the teachers to make sure they understand the information, not forget what the information is, and learn how to be more reponsible. If teachers start to design summer projects the schools will grow better than they use to be, the students will do great things with their life, and the world will be a better place.",0
"Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break. Although some may disagree, teachers should design the project. Those who disagree state that students would be more involved if they designed it themselves or chose their own prompt, but these are simply not true. The best way a summer project should be carried out is with a teacher's design, and here's why.

First off, teachers are the ones who shall grade it, so they should be the ones who choose the guidelines for that grade. This gives teachers the ability to give all the students the same thing but pick out which projects were done good. If every student designed their own project then there would be no control for what is good and what is bad. On top of that, when students all have a teacher designed project it makes it so they have to reach a certain level of effort, and not just be lazy and write two sentences. Allowing students to design their own project would most definitely enable some more lazy projects.

In addition, some students prefer to have something structured and guided so they dont have to create everything from scratch. Projects can be hard to completely design without any loopholes or flaws. Some students simply lack the creativity to think up a whole project on their own. Projects could be anything, from a potato being observed to a summer book review. Giving students that much freedom would only cause confusion among them and the teacher trying to grade many very different projects. The projects would be incomparable, so how would a teacher be able to argue that one is bad and another isn't. What if students want to help each other on their projects? well they cant if every project is unique; however, if given a prompt they can cooperate and benefit from each other in creating a unique, yet immaculate project.

Although some may disagree, students should not be allowed to design their own summer projects, they would be less efficient and become easily not gradable. Those who disagree with this statement say that students feel more relaxed doing their own project, and are more enthusiastic if they have full creative control. However, these statements are simply not true. In the end, there is many reasons why teachers should control summer projects, and whether students like it or not, it is better for all if the teacher designs them. ",0
"What is a normal day to you? Waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, then getting into car to go to work, right? That last object in that list, getting into your car, puts a strain on the environment, commonly known as pollution. Although the amount of strain that an individual may put on the environment is miniscule, the combined output of all cars in a city may be enough to damage your lungs! In Beijing, China, people wear masks outside to prevent inhalation of the dense smog surrounding the city. This has led to the development of the ""smart planning"" movement, in which city planners build dense suburbs in which cars are unneeded. Shops are a walk away, and your neighbor lives five minutes from your home. You may be asking ""Why do I care about this? I don't have heavy smog in my city."" Well when car use starts to increase in your city, that will affect both your health, and your happiness.

First off, limiting car usage will make you happier. ""How will this make me happy?"" Think about this, you go through your usual morning routine, and you only have five minutes to get to work. That's perfectly fine because, good news, your job is a three minute walk from your house! This drastically reduces stress as said in this quote from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars."" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Secondly, the smog from cities with high car usage is becoming unbearable. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" In Paris, after a few days of ""nearrecord pollution,"" enforced a partial, temporary driving ban. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following da y."" The congestion levels of Paris were down by an astonishing sixty percent after five days of the smog. Imagine that, in five days smog levels reduced by sixty percent. Imagine what the whole world could do if everyone pitched in to this trend. ""Automobiles, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmisions from tailpipes....Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" Lastly, a reduction of car use can vastly improve the economy. In Bogota, Colombia, the local government have begun to enforce a ""Day Without Cars"" in an effort to curb rising pollution levels. This has been happening for three years, and has increased profits for small shops and eateries in the area. Because of the large number of walkers and bikers, shops were able to make a larger profit with walkins that just happened to pass by the store. This is what caused more stores to open up, thus boosting the local economy. Even businessmen are enjoying these days as stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" To end this off, cars use can be greatly reduced. It is a matter of willpower, which everyone has, but some are too lazy to tap into it. The reduction of car use will have long term effects on both you and the globe. By minimizing the time you spend in a car, you are increasing your happiness, decreasing pollution, and helping boost the economy! If you think cars are a necessity in today's shrinking world, think again. New York is a perfect example in which rush hour traffic makes it impossible to get to work on time by car. Even in new small suburbs, cars are becoming a thing of the past. Tomorrow, instead of driving to work or to the store, try walking. You just might enjoy it.",0
"Dear Principal,

We do not want the grades to be a B average to play sports or other activities because the activities we get we could really be good at it and be inspired to do big things. However if you let us have sports and activities i know that we will probably do better in classes. Students would love to keep there activities to get a break from hard working in class and just have fun for a change. If the students improve while having sports and activities then taking them away unless you have

B average Will make Kids Sad and not participate in class and kids will become furious and the reason i wrote this letter is to protect the sports and activities we get you'll never know our activities like Creative Writing can help students reach there goal in life so don't ruin it and take it away. In Many ways sports help us become superstars people Become superstars by keep doing what there good at like football The movie ""The Blind Side"" was about a homeless boy named Michael He liked football he was later adopted by A lady who cared for him he was is one of the best line men today. He even stopped a airbag from killing his little brother when they were driving he ended up going to Michigan State University and Later Became a line men for the Baltimore Ravens . So I'm asking you Principal please don't take away sports and etc.

Because in order to succeed in life you have to focus on your goal.

"Community Service??

Dear principle,

I would like to help in the community service group. I think it is very important for us as student's to help in the community service. It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash can's when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i don't think another person would pick it up but they should. We don't want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. That's why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others don't want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community. Well this is what i think dear principle and i hope you like my letter!!!

Sincerely,

"""The day that mankind realizes that their creations destroy the true beauty of mother nature it will be too late."" This quote by one of our nations greatest political and environmental activists, Irvin Green, directly applies to the topic of reducing pollution. One simple, yet extremly effective way to reduce pollution is limiting the transportation methods we travel by. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place.

In many places such as Germany, Paris, and Columbia, many ambitious ideas are being put into play to help battle pollution. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", it is stated that in Vauban Germany, 70 percent of families do not own vehicles. The other 30% that do, do not have a place to park them, making them basically useless. Residents in Vauban have stopped their need for transportation, making malls and stores a walk away. In this new approach, pollution has drastically reduced in numbers and has made it a much safer and cleaner place to live.

The usage of vehicles are a double-edged sword. They may get us to where we need to go with plenty of time to spare, but what are we really loosing because of it? What we are loosing is the environment and also our health. In Paris, the pollution rate almost reached a new record high, thus forcing the partial driving pan to clear the air of the global city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", its evident that cars hurt us in more ways then we realize. Buisnesses are suffering due to the lack of transportaion avaliable to delivery their services as seen in source number two, ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue"". ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of france after five-days of intesifying smog..."" The smog was so dense that Paris officials created a law making even-numbered license plates to leave there cars at home to reduce pollution. With half of the normal amount of cars driving, it almost elimated the total accident rate, making the road a safer place to be.

Despite the benefits that come along with transportation, there are more disadvanges then advantages. Pollution is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants. Many sociologist have seen these statistics and have also noticed that American transportation usuage has slowly been declining since its peak in 2005. People are slowly but surely helping the cause in their own ways, whether its by delaying getting there license, limit there driving, or even car-pooling with friends. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place to be.    ",0
"Some schools want students to continue their education outside of school so that the students will be prepared for the following school year and so that the teachers won't have to spend their class time reteaching a certain subject. But the summer projects that schools give to their students are more then likely made by teachers making those projects not fun and boring. Students should be the ones make the projects because they lose some of their summer do to working on the teacher's project. If the students were to make these summer projects they will be fun, not as time consuming, and not difficult.

Summer projects should be fun for the students so that they will actually learn and remember what the project was actually about over the summer break. So if a student make their own project they will try to make as fun as possible for themselves for their summer break and the project won't make their summer boring. If a student has a project in a science class the student could make a project about wildlife and the could keep track of all the different animals they seen over their summer. Another class that a student should make their own project in is history because the student could write down all the historical buildings and places that they seen over the summer break while traveling. The summer is a time for students to relax and stop worrying about school and homework but if a school decides to give out a summer projects the students should be allowed to make it as fun as they want it to be for themselves.

Next a summer project should not be extremely time consuming so the students will actually have time to enjoy their break from school. If teachers were to make a summer project it would take all summer but if a student was to make a project it wouldn't be very long. Most students will travel throughout their summer break so a long summer project will stop them from traveling as much as possible but if the project was shorter they could travel more and experience life to the fullest. If a English teacher was to make a summer project it may require a students to read 15 books over their break, but if a student make that project for English they could lower that amount to 4 book meaning the have more time to have more fun and not sit around reading all the time. The summer is about fun and not school work so if a school decides to make a summer project the student should be the one who decides how long it should take and not the teachers.

Finally a schools project should never be difficult because summer is supposed to a stress free time and the time for students to relax. If a project is too difficult a student will not want to do it at all and so they will not understand anything when they go over said project the following year, but if a student was to make the project it be easy so they will actually want to do it over their break and understand what may happen that following year. If a student is make their own project they will make it easy so that they will have no issue working on the project over the break and will get a good grade the following year on said project. If a math teacher was to give a summer project that makes students work out a big packet with a ton of questions in it a student will never finish it and they will receive a bad grade, but if a student was to make the packet it would shorter and a whole lot easier for themselves not requiring the student to struggle over their break. The more difficult a summer project is the student will never learn from it but if a student was to make their own it wouldn't be difficult and they would continue to learn over their summer break.

In conclusion a student should be allowed to make their own summer projects because teachers make everything more difficult then possibly needed. A summer project needs to be fun, easy, and short so a student can enjoy their summer to the fullest and still come back to school the next year ready to learn. So if a student make their summer project they will fufill the school by still learning and still having a great summer.",0
"Studying planets is often hard because of the conditions in space, and also on the planet Venus there are also very harsh conditions that humans cannot survive. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Exploring Venus can be a very risky planet for us to expore until we get better technology.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.",0
"One article say's ''Dose your expresion in the mirro suggest an emotion''? This talks about how easyer it would be to know how others feal. I think it may actiually be bad becaus some people like to not have there privacy invaded by other normal people using a computer. People like to keep there personal thoughts to them selves I don't like the idea of reading peoples mines. We should not do this becaus it might make things easyer at the same time harder. I don't think technology will make things easyer nomader what there will always be trouble.

The article is supporting this claim becaus they are curiuos and think things would be easyer with this new machine. They can use it to detect the fealings of old paintings like the Mona Lisa and they can use it on peole too. They want to use this for students they think it would help with there difficulties. I don't like this becaus too me it's like spying on somebody.

I think we should only use this for paintings like the Mona Lisa but not on people who are still alive. This would to me make people oncofortable. This is like invading someones privacy and being rude. Even when I disagree with this people will still use it all becaus they are so curious. I think it should only be used for certan things not for school or anything else.",0
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform it has been a pop icon since it started in HollyWood Films, Books, Magazines, Talk shows, and haunted check-out lines for more than 20 years!. How could The Face on Mars be created by aliens if aliens aren't real? Why would NASA go through all that trouble to make a fake Face on Mars.

The face is a natural landform because, before it was a face NASA captioned it as a ""Huge rock formation"". It was a humans head it was also formed by shadows, which made it seem like the huge rock formation had eyes, nose, and a mouth. But it was just an illusion. NASA knew that if they were to put the ""huge rock formation"" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right! As soon as the huge rock formation was on Mars that's when NASA started getting all the attention NASA knew was coming.

So this is why I state that NASA's ""huge rock formation"" is NOT fake, like I said earlier why would NASA go through so much trouble just to make a fake humans head on Mars? ",0
"Dear Principal,

I feel we should have the first policy. I think it is a good compromise.

The teachers and the students will both get what they want. Phones can be beneficial to the school system. Students will have to know that this is a privilege and can easily be taken away.

During free time if they have nothing to do they would be able to communicate silently with their friends. They could even get help on homework by texting someone from a different room. Some phones even have internet which could be helpful for research reports. The phones will keep the students occupied when they have nothing else to do in study halls or free periods. This will keep the classroom silent for people who really need to concentrate on their work. Talking to friends will help relieve some stress during the day and since they can't talk to all their friends because of different schedules this phone policy will help them to do that.

Teachers will also benefit from this policy because the students will hopefully follow the rules so they are able to text at their free times. Some kids will be less talkative if they were able to tell someone what they needed to tell them before the class. Also if the teachers have the students numbers they could remind them to study and do their homework.

Phones are becoming a big part of the world. Especially in the U.S. Some students will want to break the no phone rule simply because there is a rule. My grandpa always says if there are no rules you can't break any rules. As long as students realize there will be consequences and that this phone policy can easily be taken away then everything should go well.

It could take a little time to get use to so you could try this policy for a month and see how it goes. If it doesn't go well then try it again in another few months. After a while it should catch on. I feel that this will benefit the school tremendously. Please take this in consideration.            ",0
"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers it presents because ''...may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system''.

If that's the case, we should most definitely try to explore Venus. It would be hard but possible because NASA has ''compelling ideas for sending humans to study Venus''. Their idea was to ''allow scientists to float above the fray''. Meaning they would be about 30 miles or so in the air avoiding Venus's harsh ground conditions. Since their about 30 miles above the surface, the temperatures would be a cozy 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the air pressure would close to that of sea levels on Earth and radiation would not exceed Earth's levels. This isn't easy conditions for humans but it's survivable.

However, hovering over Venus from a ship above the planet is safe but it can't get us certain information that we'll need like samples of gas, rocks, or anything else. But the good news is, NASA is working on other alternatives to study Venus. An example of this would be, ''...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks...'', Another example would be, mechanical computers. Mechanical computers are devices that make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics what so ever. Though modern computers are powerful, they tend to be weak when it comes to extreme physical conditions. ''By comparison,systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces''.

In conclusion, We will eventually get to Venus and when we do, we will not only gain insight on the planet, but we will also get to see what human curiosity can lead us to. Our travels in space should not be limited by doubts and dangers because without doubt and danger how will we expand our horizons and learn? ",0
"Whenever you happen to find yourself in a situation where you need to make a decision, it it always good to have advice from others. Whether that advice is good or bad, it may be beneficial to you making a final decision. Most of the time, it is great to have multiple opinions on what decision you are about to make and if that is the best decision or not. It can prove crucial to making the best decision for you, and even others. By seeking multiple opinions from others before you make a decision, you can get more of an understanding about what other people think, get help by narrowing down options to choose from, and it can even open you up to even more good ideas.

Most people, when they have to make a decision, would want to know what other people would do in that instance. For example, a person could be shopping for clothes, and they might be stuck between two options to choose from. That person would want some help with trying to decide, so they would ask a few people about what they thought. By asking those people, the person would get feedback from the people that were asked, and that feedback would give the person a greater understanding about what others think. This can apply to any decision being made, not just when it comes to shopping. The advice that you receive just by asking other people helps you out a great deal when making a choice. This isn't the only benefit of seeking multiple opinions, though.

The next reason as to why seeking more than one opinion before making a choice is that by dong so, it will help you narrow down your options to choose from. You may have many different thoughts about what decision or choice you are going to make. There may be a lot of them, and you are going to have to narrow them down eventually. The best way to do that is to ask people for their advice. The people you ask will give you the advice that you need to make the best and smartest choice. Sometimes, some of the options you were thinking of may not have been brought up. It may have been because they were not as important as other options, or simply just because it would not be a good choice. Nonetheless, opinions from multiple people will help you eliminate unhelpful options or ones that are just of no use, which contributes to the greater idea on why seeking multiple opinions is beneficial to you making a decision.

The third and final benefit of seeking multiple opinions before making a decision or choice is that it may open you up to even more good ideas that you have not thought of or considered before. For instance, there could be something that you have to decide on, so you ask multiple people for advice. Those people might suggest an idea that is really good, and that idea could be better than one that you have previously thought of. This is why asking more than one person for advice can be extremely beneficial. The people you ask can come up with a great idea that will lead to you making the best choice that is possible, which is what you always want to do no matter what.

Overall, these 3 reasons provide a great overall conclusion that whenever you have to make a decision of any kind, you should always get some advice from multiple people. It proves to be very beneficial in the long run. By doing so, you can make the smartest and most logical choice. When you ask multiple people for their opinion, you will get a better understanding about what others think, get help by narrowing down options for you to choose from, and you may be introduced to more good ideas. These are 3 major benefits that come from getting multiple opinions before making a decision, and they tell exactly why you should do so. Whenever you happen to find yourself in one of those situations, you should ask multiple people for advice, as it will make your decision a lot easier to choose.            ",0
"Dear principal

I don't really agree with your decision because three are many people that try there best and the still get a c as there average. It wouldn't be fear for them thee are a lot of people that are not interesting in sports and they get A,B most of the time. i think if you were in there feet you would feel very bad. that's why if you change the police there would be people upset and the would be an argument going on.

But then it would be great to change the police because people that have C,D,E,F, well get A,B for order them to secrecies there grades to play and get good grads people well change and make the school better. well that's what i think in between both of them. this is the way i think because people these days are dropping out of school for the bad grade and i think i would be a grate police to change. So the students well have a challenge to look up to. people should always have apartments to try different things.      ",0
"Florida State Senator, The Electoral College is a crucial part of the United state's election process. There are some negatives to the Electoral College but the positives outweigh them by a landslide. The certainty of the outcome and having a president that the majority likes are key beneficial factors to the Electoral College process that would be lost if we changed the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

With the Electoral College, there is a very rare chance that there would be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. However, according to In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" A clear winner will always be produced with the slight informality of a tie. In 2012's election, Barack Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote compared to the 61.7% of the electoral vote. If the election process was by popular vote, it would have been a much closer race between Obama and rodney.

To win the Electoral College vote, each region must like you. You cannot have a presidential candidate that favors one region and only one region favors that candidate.

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner states, ""...a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" In contrast, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer claims that even ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" What Is the Electoral College?

by the Office of the Federal Register says, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President."" Because of the number of electoral votes each state has is based on population, meaning Texas has more votes than Rhode Island, every presidential candidate focuses on winning over the big states. The big states are a better representation of our nation's opinion. The Electoral College process should not be replaced by the popular vote due to the extremely rare chance of a tie. It should remain because an outcome is certain and majority of the population would like the president.",0
"I would keep the Electoral College because it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. If people want to change the election for popular votes  is basically your generallly chosen by the candidates politcal party...and what their responsibilities are. My response to that not everybody is chosen by politcal party.

Now, if people want to change the election by popular voting is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for presidents because when you vote for your candidates you are actually voting for your candidates electors. My response to that is..sometimes presidents want to be president because ""they want to change everything in the United States like ..taxes..and health insurance. For example like Obama care he has change the health insurance and people dont like that. And 2016 theres going to be a new President in the United States.    ",0
"Dear Principal,

I consider that policy 1 is above par because of numerous reasons. Most students need their cell phone so their family and friends can contact them when needed. Some kids need their phone for the internet, like if their doing some kind of project that involves research then they'll need it. Most kids need to call their parents after school to let them know where their going to be after school, you never know what could happen.

Policy 2 is not the best choice because a lot of children are stubborn and not allowing phones to be on campus is just going to make them want to bring them even more. Some students are followers so if they see their friend bringing a cell phone to school then their eventually going to bring one too. I suggest you go with policy number 2 unless you want to hear complaints from angry parents, choose believe.",0
"Dear senator of florida state,

I believe the united states should get rid off the electorial college as we all know the electorial college consists of 538 slectors in which a majority of 270 electorial votes are required to elect the president. In response to this the citizens of the U.S.A are technically not voting for the president but voting for the group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party in which as stated in source 1

""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.""

As stated in source 2 voters cannot always control who they are voting for and voters often get confused about the electors and voting for the wrong candidate.

The evidence to support this claim is the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis of the century. State legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Evidence form source 2 goes back to 1960 when segregationists in the louisiana legistlature almost succeded in replacing democratic electors with new electors that did not support and oppose John F. Kennedy thus proving that the electorial college cannot be trusted. Another reason why the electorial college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between ""swing"" states. Evidence from the 2000 campaign states seventeen states didn't see candidates at all.

Most worrying would be the prospect of the tie in the electoral vote by any means in that type of case the election would be assigned for the House of Representatives where state delegations vote on the president because each state cast only one vote.

An example of this would be the representative from wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have more to say including the representative from california who represents 35 million voters. Those voters vote for one party for president and one for congress, the decision of the house can barely be reflected on the will of the people. supporting this is the election in 1968 in which a shift of 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election another election in 1976 a tie would occur if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

Though the electoral college is an anachronism it is not democratic in a modern sense because the electors are the ones who choose the president not us the people though each party has to select of slate of electors who are intrusted to vote for the party's nominee. Although the electoral college method despites its lack of democrastic pedigree is still used today its because of its certainty of outcome the reason is because the winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote, and also avoids run off elections to happen. Another reason why the electoral college method is still used today is as stated in source 3 because it restores weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal- appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The electoral colege requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

Even thogh these reasons oppose my claim as stated in source 2 the electoral college is unfair, oudated and irrational.

An example of this was in 2012 when obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote against 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney

Basically what the electoral college method is a method where only the electoral vote is more importnant than the popular vote or the peoples vote.

In which It supports my claim when I said the people are not voting for the president but for the group of electors who support the candidate. In the example of 2012 obama vs romney obama won because of the percentage of the electorial vote which means that a candidate that is running for president can win the election if the electoral vote surpasses the popular vote.            ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing you in regards to a certain school policy. I believe that students should be able to play sports with a C average. Not all students can help whether or not their grades are all A's and B's. I mean, not everyone is perfect and not everyone is good in school, no matter how hard they try. Maybe it's the teacher's fault, maybe it's your fault. Who knows? I understand that kids can be slackers and lazy. But the outcome of that would be F's and D's. If you think that children having a C is bad, then imagine what's going to happen when you kick them off of their sports team. They're not going to care about their grades. Maybe they only kept it up because sports meant so much to them. Basically, if you take those sports away, they won't be trying anymore. They won't have that drive, and they won't have the topic of ""sports"" in the back of their mind every time they take a test or should be doing homework. I can honestly say that I don't like to play sports, at all. I've taken a liking to them, but I just don't find playing them very enjoyable. If you took sports from me, I wouldn't care. I get C's all the time. Imagine what grades I would have if I was pushed to get even better grades, by being told I'd have the privilege to do something I love. So I'm putting myself in my classmates' shoes. So many of them want to play basketball, lacrosse, soccer, softball, football, baseball, and more, for the rest of their lives. If you cause them to give up now, that's stopping them from doing that. You wouldn't like to be a dream crusher, now would you? So, long story short; Kids who have C's completely deserve to play sports and participate in certain activities. If you take away this new policy and let it be a warning to all students, I'm sure that some grades will go up. I'm being honest and straight-forward with you. There's no reason to take away something we love, because of a passing, acceptable grade. I hope you took what I had to say to heart, and that you think about it. I hope to hear a response soon. Thank you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think this is a good idea because a lot of students are getting a C average. If students really want to participate in a sport or other activities, then they will have to try hard to bring their grades up. If they bring their grades up then that would be a good thing and they get to participate in sports or activities. To some students, sports are their life so if they really want it then they have to get the grades. Getting the grades will improve their scores and they get what they want. But some students might go against it. If you just think about it, there's really no point to join a sport with a C average because for one, they won't try at school because what's the point of trying when you already have what you want? And two, they won't worry about anything else except for their sport. Now if you ask me what I think is better, I would say the first one. You get good grade and what you want! The only thing i would ask is; Who wouldn't pick the first one? (:",0
"Dear Principal,

I think Student should clean up litter because its good for the comminute, good for the environment, and other things. I'm telling you why people should pick up litter.

The first reason is that its good for the comminute. I mean really who wants to sit in a dirty school that has germs and other bad stuff. I wouldn't like that at all because i like to be a clean person and that is just gross to be at a school that hasn't been cleaned up since who knows when.

The second reason is that its good for the environment. It would be nice if people would clean up the environment because I like to see trees and animals but what i don't like is died trees and animals because what people through out of there car window for example soda rings those can kill a lot of animals.

The third reason is that it good for people to do. Like what I just said its good for both comminute and environment. It gets people active and going and its some thing to do when your bored.

That is why I think students should clean up litter. They are helping the comminute, environment, and the trees and the animals. Thank you principal for all your time.

"To State Senator,

I think the Electoral College should be changed to popular vote because we have a lot of close presedential race nowadays. We also need to change the voting system because candidates are focusing on the ""swing states"" instead of all the states in the U.S.A. We also have the problem where one candidate can win the Electoral College and the other candidate can win the popular vote. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes. If we get rid of the Electoral College then we won't have to deal with people stressing about the candidate who should've won and the candidate who actually won.

I would rather have my vote be counted towards the president that I picked instead of electors who might pick that person. If I live in a democratic state and I'm Republican, then my vote is most likely not going to count because the electors are going to vote for the other president since the state is known to be a democratic state. Then we wonder why people don't vote; it's mostly because they know which candidate is going to win that state. With popular vote , nobody knows who will win the presidency because all 50 states have equal representation. No one state will be greater than the other.

According to paragraph 9  ""A Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AL Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election,"" this proves that people are already thinking about having the direct election rather than the Electoral College.

"Dear state senator, i have sent you this letter to tell you that we should not abolish the Electoral College, the Electoral College has many benefits when voting for president. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anchorism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president. In 2012 the election for president, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to Romneys 51.3. Because most states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the slightest plurality in a state can cause a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Though a tie is possible because the total number of votes is 538, it is very unlikely.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No state has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the thoughtful voters. A large state will recieve more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.    ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME

Some people might think that doing community service is mindless and stupid, but i think it's a great way to help people who don't have a well planned out education or who don't have a house or just cleaning up the environment. I help the community out by cleaning up litter, donating my old clothes to the poor, also by donating canned food to the soup kitchen and by recycling. The people who don't want to do community service don't have to, they can just help out by donating canned foods or just recycling cans. I think you don't have to make the students do community service if they don't want to. Just put up sign up sheets in the hallways and have people sign up on their own time or just create a group that cleans up the school grounds before or after school hours. Some of my friends disagree with me about community service, but they can think what they want to think and so can I. I for one think that doing community service is a good thing.

"Do you think drivers should use their phone at any capacity while driving? Some people may think different but I think it's very dangerous. There have been 3,153 injuries, and 424,000 deaths dealing with texting while driving. Texting while driving has been happening all over the world, and for many many years since the cell phone has been made. It also takes away the perception of the road meaning everyone would be taking their eyes off the road. Social media is another liability while texting in the car.

Having the phone while driving has been a daily part of life since the phone was invented in 1972. Texting while driving has been a part of daily life since messaging was put into use on the cell phone. People urge to text and drive because once they get that first text they don't want to stop replying. ""Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have fueled a spike in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past two years"".

People don't understand the dangers and necessities of keeping your eyes on the road, because the death rate continues to go up and on one care to change it.

There are many different types of phones all across the world not even in the United States alone. ""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 80% of all car crashes are related to driver inattention"". There are overall seven state with bans on cell phones in the hand while driving. No one understands why everyone all over the world desires to keep their phone in their hand at all times be it always happens. Even when there is a passenger in the car for example a Jamaican man and his family he would sometimes still text and drive if he wife weren't in the car.

No one can see while you're looking at your phone that's the reason while everyone is crashing on the road now a days. Texting is in one of the top ten categories of the most dangerous causes of death in the U.S lone. Technology in vehicles are causing drivers to be on the phone as well taking their eyes off the road. Looking at your phone cause the driver to either hit a bystander or an animal. ""Statistics state that on average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to distracted driving"".

No matter what everyone should just put the phone down while driving because everyone would be even more safe.

In conclusion there are many different views on whether the phone should be allowed in the car while driving. There are many problems with phones being in cars and since it has been made accidents are still going to happen. Cars are being totaled, lives are being lost, and people are being injured because of phone and driving. Sometimes many would think if the phone wasn't invented would the death rate have stayed the same or would everything be different. Phones don't need to have that big of an impact of people's lives because that's not good or healthy for any body's life. Phone shouldn't be allowed in these days, or the future of any body's hands in a car because of all the risks and what has happened in the past.       ",0

Also when you turn 18 you will be old enough to join the military service. You can also have fun when your in the Seagoing Cowboys they play sports like baseball, tennis, basketball, and they also have reading clubs adn writing clubs.

I would join the Seagoing Cowboys if I could. Just think about it, why wouldnt you. Its a very unique group of people and they go on adventures and they have fun also what more could you ask for. There is one thing though, when you travel to far places it will take long periods of time like weeks.      ",0
"I think this kind of technology could be useful in a classroom. Most days, kids feel bored or tired just sitting in a class listening to a teacher talk. If we had this technology, kids could get more free time playing on the computer and when the computer notices boredom, then it could make the lesson more fun. If it can help kids learn, then it might be a good investment.

I am for the new technology. If computers could tell someones emotions, I would use it to explain my emotions. I could figure out what is wrong with my friends if they weren't acting normal. I think it is amazing.

To conclude, I think it would be cool to have this kind of technology. For computers to have technology like that, is mindblowing. We could use it to see how other feel about certain things. Like if you want to computer to learn fear, put someone that is scared of scary movies in a dark room and play scary movies until they get scared. Then have the computer scan them and see how it works. You could do this with any emotion. I like this technology. I think it is a good and practical investment. ",0
"If school can offer options to students to finish school at home is great because they want students can learn and give them more opportunities. Students can be more benefit if they attend to school and they can learn more than to did at home. Also there are many students can't come to school because they have a job and they have to did school at home. Students are not that much of prepare if they did school at home. If students could attend to school it can be great for them to be more able to did more prepared them for the future. Also that can get opportunities if they attend to school and good reviews from teachers.

If students attend to school there are more ways to learn. Also students can be more able to ask more question to teachers. If they did classes from home that are not able to ask a lot of question and they can't met friend who can be a big help for them. If you attend to school also teachers can prepared you more and they talk to you if you did wrong in classes. All teachers in school i believe that they can see your capacity or level that you are and at home they just give you work and they didn't know anything about the student. The teacher at school can see the way that you better learn and they can work with the student to don't fell classes because the know you better if you go to school. Home school is a great idea for people that can't come to school.

In the world are students that can't attend to a school because they have a job or others problems to go to school. In the world is not only one single reason to don't attend to school. Many of the students that can't attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work can't give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they don't attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students can't come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they don't receive a good chance to learn more.

Students at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it. School also you can practice more if you are learning and at home you can't practice what you learn. If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you can't practice it. If you did school at home there are also many distractions that you can't concentrate and if you are not concentrated in what your working on you are not going to understand what you are doing. If you are in a classroom teachers make sure that you are concentrated in your own work and they also make sure that you are doing right that why students who attend to schools can be more prepared than students who did school at home.

In conclusion if you have time and the opportunity to attend to school you should do it because you will learn and get more opportunities. If you can't attend to a school and you are doing school at home you must concentrated in your work and don't get distracted. Also if you are receiving school at home you must find some one who you can work with to practice. The opportunity that many school offer is a great idea. School wants to students can complete their dreams even if they can't assist to a school. But the schools are giving opportunities to finish at home and must students should appreciate that because school is thinking about the future of the society. In fact school programs are working for people who really want to have opportunities and make their dreams true.",0
"Driverless cars can be a bad thing and a good thing for the world. Driverless cars would be a bad idea when it comes to the saftey of people. Driverless cars could also be a good thing for the econmy and earth.

Driverless cars would not be such a good idea just because you dont really know if the technology is actually gonna work and be safe for people. Most technology if not all technology have probles sometimes. Just think of a car driving its self down the road and all of the sudden something goes wrong with the car and the car causes and accident where a few poeple got hurt or die. If something like this happens whos fault is it? The person in the vehicle or the people who desighned the vehicle?

We've been creating computer driven cars that also have a feature that the driver in the vehivle can take over and control the vehivle at any time. Apple reciently is making a car that drives its self but can also be driven by a person controling the vehicle. In my opinion thats ten times safer than a car that drives on it own. Most newer cars these days have features like Antilock breaking systems or sencors that make a vehicle back into an area or parking spot on its own. Ford Reacenlty came out with a truck that back itself up to hook onto a traler insted of the driver having to do it. During this period of the truck hooking to a traler by its self the driver has an option to use that feature or do it manualy.

In this passage it talks about BMW having a car with a feature called Traffic Jam Assistance witch is that the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, and it also has special touch sencors to make sure the driver keeps ahold of the steering wheele and is alert during this time.

As of right now I dont belive we have and cars that copletely drive them selfs, but alot of newer cars these days have features that can help assist you in stituations when needed. Some cars stop on there own if your getting to close to another vehicle and the driver is not paying attention. Those are the type of vehivles we need. We dont need cars that can drive themselfs that coud have something go wrong with the car and cause a reck or endager lifes. Even in some states it is illegal to test computer driven cars. I wonder why? It's probably becase they might not be sucha good idea.

Now there are positives to drivelss cars. People would save money by not having to buy or use there cars when they have cars that can drive them around. The driveless cars would be good on gas so money would be saved on gas. Also not using much gas is good for our enviorment because it would be less polution to the earth if everyone started switching to using driveless cars. I think there are more negatives in this situation then positives.

To sum all of this up Im not sure if drivless cars are sucha good idea or ever will be a good idea untill later in the future after the technology has been tested for many of years and advanced to the fullest to where it has the capability of hadling a driveless car.    ",0
"Why do we vote? We vote so we can choose a candidate that we can trust to make the best decisions for our country. But what's the point of voting if we have an Electoral College. We are not actually voting to ellect a president, we are voting for electors, who elect the president. The Elecotral College should be shut down, because everyone should have their right to vote for who they they want to vote for, not have electors do it for them.

""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This shows that more than half the voters, would rather just vote the president instead of having the Electoral College do it for them. ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" This means that the President who gets the most popular votes is less likely to win over the electors votes. It seems like the electors are never agreeing with people's votes because, usually the popular vote never wins. But the Electoral College should stay up for certain reasons.

""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" The Electoral College helps with a certain percentage of people who aren't giving the best decisions on the candidate they are choosing. But that still doesn't mean that people shouldn't have their right to vote for who they think is best candidate. It should be the people's decision on who they want to vote for, not the electors. There would be no reason to vote if the people's vote don't really mean anything.

People should have their right to vote for who they think is best. That is why people are given the right to vote. The Electoral College just takes that right away. Presidents who win because of electoral votes, are not fairly chosen because, not many voters agreed on him, the electors did. The candidate that won popular votes, should be President, because most people agree on him and his choices. Let the people's votes count toward presidency.                                                                 ",0
"Distance learning, which is school from your home, is an option some students have today. I believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. When you're some place comfortable, you tend to put things aside for ""later"". Personal issues and family issues may be an impact to your learning. Not all students are fortunate enough to be available to internet access or access to technology as in computers or laptops. Procrastination, distractions, and no access to internet are reasons to why distance learning is not beneficial.

Distance learning brings alot of procastination. Procastination is something that every human being will do. We tend to put things aside, and sometimes never finish. When we get comfortable, we forget. Students who work, procastinate the most. For example, I usually work until 11pm, so when I am backed up on a lot of homework, in all honesty, I choose to stay home. I end up sleeping in, never finishing the work I told myself I'd do. Clearly, When you're put to be at home to learn, you continuously tell yourself that you will eventually do it, you end up either turning it in late, rushing the assignments that lead to bad grades, or not turning in anything at all. When you're physically at school, you recieve support and encouragement from teachers, which in most cases eliminates procrastination. Procrastination will impact your learning when doing online classes.

Distractions is a huge problem students will face when trying to complete online classes. Everyday isn't a good day. Sometimes you have personal issues and emotional feelings that will distract you from finishing your assignments. On the other hand, when you're at school you tend to hold off on personal issues until you get home. Some students who do online courses have different times of completing daily assignments and some choose evenings to work mornings. Therefore, in the evenings, students will face family distractions. Evenings is the time families start arriving from work or school. For example, my sister used to do online classes to be able to graduate on time, she would go to work early in the mornings, and complete online tasks in the evenings. We have a lot of younger siblings who make alot of noise, which was a huge distraction to her. She would put aside the work until 8pm to be able to complete her assignments in peace. The result in leaving her assignments until late, caused her exhaustion in trying to keep up with her job and school work. Online classes is not benficial for those with families, which is majority of the people.

Interent access and availability of technology is something not every student is fortunate enough to have. In order to complete, they would have to use a type of transportation to go to a public library, in which, not all students have. Nowadays, you would expect everybody to have some sort of technology because of the type of society we live in. Last year, around spring time, I met a very sweet kid who was bullied for not having a phone or a tv in his house. He proceeded with a story of abuse from his father and how his father denied him anything with technology. He lived five houses down the street and I offered him to come sit in my house if he needed to complete any assignments. He then told me his father didn't let him out the house. Clearly, not every single person is available to internet and technology. Sometimes you might have a laptop and some wifi, but when times get rough and your family can't pay for wifi anymore, you won't be able to complete your assignments, causing you to fail. It's a risk you should not take. On the other hand, if you're at school you're not denied the use of school wifi or technology.

To sum up, school from home, also called distance learning, is a choice students have in some schools. Distance learning will not benefit students who attend classes at home. Students will face daily challenges in order to finish online classes. There is less good benefts than bad benefits when it comes to distance learning. Students will most likely get too comfortable and put aside work, making them procrastinate, deal with personal and emotional issues causing distractions, lastly, the challenges of having available internet access and an available electric device.",0
"In my opinion I think it will be a good idea for the teachers to know if a student is in a good mood or not. When a teacher calls on a student and dont not want to go the teacher might think it is because that child is being rude, and all that the child want is to be left alone.

With the scaning programs, that could scan your face and can tell if you are in a good mood or not, teachers and student could have a good bond. If the teacher scans a kid face in morning when they all enter class she could know who to call on ,or maybe even after class she could even have a talk with the child. If someone can tell how a person feel if it's fear , anger ,digust, happiness,and surprise.

Those are some examples of ways it will be useful to have the ""Facial Action Coding System"". That type of technolgy would be very valuable in the classroom,and maybe even outside of school.",0
"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people.",0
"dear principal,

I truly believe that not all students should be apart of community service. And these are my reasons to back it up. My first reason is that some kids do want to help their community and make it a better place, but some kids have a lot to of stuff to do and can't really fit that in. My second reason is that most kids are just plain lazy. Don't want to do anything with there lives or do something for their community. So it really would be a waste of time trying to make students go and do community service because all they is going to do is just sit there and complain or just don't come. So from my point of view as a student

I think that you should have kids decide on going to do community service. and decide what time is good for them to go and do it!

Thank you.",0
"Dear state senator, I believe that we shouldn't keep the electoral college process because it should be in favor of the popular vote for the president of the Unites States instead of how it is now. I believe this becasue for example with this system voters don't vote for the president but for the slate of electors even though this system does come with some positives like it allows them to focus on their campaign efforts but can turn into a complete disaster factor.

To begin with,the system of the electoral college does not allow the voters to vote for the president but only for a slate of electors, they are the ones who elect the president. There is always an off-chance that those electors that won the statewide election would go to Congress and the opponent recieves more electoral votes. The electors are chosen from the state they could be state conventions, or the state party's central committee and even sometimes the presidential candidate themselves. This system then leads to several cons such as the voters can not control whom their electors vote for and also the voters tend to get confused sometimes about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

Although, maybe we should be able to keep our despised method of choosing the president because, it comes with several pro's like for example, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible like in 2012's election when Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the votes that came from Romney. In this election the winner is aware with the electoral votes which induces the candidates and allows them to focuses on their campaign efforts. Lead them to the toss-up states which basically mean they are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign so the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Last but not least, this system is also known a the disaster factor like for example the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century because they had to consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and that they will always define the will of those people. Many of the electors have occasionally refused to vote for their own party candidate and even cast a deciding vote for whomever it is that they want or perfer to please. this method should not be prohibeded any more because of the causes it is doing which is affec

In conclusion it is official the the system of the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and also it is concluded to be an irrational system. I still believe that the electoral college should be elected by popular vote for the president.    ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think community service is a very important requirement to have in schools. We all live in a community, so we all need to work as a community.

Where would we be if people didn't help each other out? If we didn't take the time to do something for the ones around us? No where. We would all still be living in caves! community service has helped us all at some point. even if it doesn't have to-do directly with ourselves, like cleaning the trash out for parks or giving clothes and other necessities to Goodwill or The Salvation Army.

Lending a hand in some way would teach kids life lessons we would carry with us for the rest of our lives. Spending time in the community just a few times a month would teach hard work, how to work well with others, and how in order to be able to take you have to give back. Also how to accept differences, because everyone you meet wont be the same as you are, or think the same as you might.

I understand many students are not open to this idea or don't want to work out side of school. Extra credit could be offered as a way to help motivate students. An extra point couldvery hour spend working in the community. high school credits could be given. maybe you could choose how much time a month you would spend doing community service. there could be a group service project so you could work with friends to make it seem like fun!

Community service is necessary in our world to be able to perform and have the things that we do. it teaches life lessons that might help in a job search later in life. that is why in my opinion there should be a community service requirement at our school.

Sincerely,

"Dear principal,

I would recommend policy 1 because it is better to at least use your cell phone for a little while than to never use it at all. I would love to be able to have that rule because I know a lot of ways that I can use my cell phone. Like when I'd need help for math I can use my phone as a calculator to work out the math problems easily. And if you need help finding one of your friends that know where your next class is you can just text them. My phone also has Internet so I can look for information about tons of stuff like looking for good info to add to your project. And the biggest rule is that our parents say that they should also be used for emergency calls too. But of course, we know that all of those examples will be used during lunch or in between classes. I know that many students in my school will enjoy this rule a lot because they love to use their cell phones every day. But if you never put up that rule, then lots of kids will start to break the rules again and again. I know that can be very frustrating for you and the counselors knowing that our school has some bad kids in it. So please, can you put up that rule for us? Because that can be so cool.

Sincerely,

One of your best students!",0
"Imagine if we accomplish more, if we are always doing something. Some people accomplished their goals in life, but some people dont do nothing to accomplished what they want. I would like to accomplish my goals in life; there are three thing that I would like to accomplish: having a success career, graduate from high school with an advance diploma, and studied the area of medical. I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community.

My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad.

My second reason, helping our community. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live. Helping other people good or bad. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries.

My last reason, being active anywhere we are. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people.

Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. Being active is very important because of your health. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout. Some people accomplish something and some people dont accomplish nothing. If people accomplish what they want, there, would be no purpose. In mt opinion people should accomplish what they want in life. I hope people could accomplish something in life.",0
"Phones and Driving

Distractions can serve as a curse and a blessing. Not giving full attention to what we should be doing makes us miss deadlines, fail classes and crash into other drivers. Distractions sure comes with a price! Mobile phone use while driving is a particularly important form of driver distraction. It can increase the risk of traffic accidents by up to four times.

Our brains have a limited ability to focus. We can't pay attention to everything around us at once so we must choose what to focus on. For instance, while driving we are supposed to keep our eye on the road , but as soon as our phones chime the brain automatically wants to check the phone ,taking your focus off the road and to the distraction which can cause you to crash into other drivers. Due to our brains ability to focus on one thing at a time NO driver should be allowed to have a mobile device while driving a motor vehicle.

Talking on a cell phone may be less distracting than some other activities people may engage in while driving. Sadly, some people still don't get this one. Alcohol has an effect on your motor skills and judgment, meaning you just simply just cannot drive and be intoxicated at the same time .Research shows an increased risk of death for drivers who have been distracted by their phones checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Even though phones can cause a distraction your focus should be on the road. Therefore, drivers should not be allowed to use phones or be under any kind of influence while driving.

To conclude, no drivers should be allowed to have an operating mobile device while driving simply because your brain won't be able to process a car and a phone at the same time. Driving can be dangerous business. Every year, a shocking number of people lose their life or are severely injured while traveling in vehicles. Leave your phone in your pocket or purse and take it out once the car is stopped. Save your life and the text.         ",0

""in my opinion online class is very hard""

. And doesn't have benefit. when there is no teacher in class to help students, and some of students are too lazy. they need some body to pust them in class.

june 7,2017. I took my online class. And i was new in USA. That was really hard for me, because i was new here and, i didn't know. How i need to do my works? So that wasn't fun. And i didn't get any thing from that class. Because the class was boring for me and very day works became alot so, unfortunately i drop my class. It is very different; when we are in normal class or we are in online class. Because in normal class, there is a teacher, students and a lots of things to they can make class very easy for students. And have a lots of benenfits, but in online class there is noting of these stuff are in online class. And some times online class make students to skip

, because when they face to face with a problom. They can not ask from online class, teacher direct that make students to skip the class, and make the class boring for students, that is what happend with me. And some times student can not have good attend in class, and that can make student to drop the class.

As wall as online class and conferencing class are the hardest classes. But nothing is impossible in this life we can do it "" with hard work and with a good attend in our class"". If i need to take online class in future. I will always try to have communication with my teacher. Because teacher is the only person to can help the student on that class.",0
"The central idea of this article is ""That studying venus i s a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" I do not agree that the article supports this idea. The author talks about all the geological/environmental challenges it presents, talks about how we haven't set a space craft there in three decades that wasn't even manned and only lasted a few hours, and how the planet isn't liveable.

The first reason I don't think the author supports the idea is because more than half of the essay is them talking about how Venus is awful when it comes to the actual form and environment of Venus. The environment of Venus was spoken about throughout the essay stating ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acis in Venus's atmosphere."" This is creates huge challenge for scientists to explore Venus. The plsnet is also too hot like 10x way too hot. It states in the article, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" The author talks about how the environment is SO extreme that it would crush submarines and liquefy many metals.

The second reason I don't think the author supports the idea is they talk about how they haven't sent anything there in three decades. They can't send anything there because of how bad the conditions are on Venus and nothing has ever survived. It states in the article, ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each...mission was unmanned....since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" The reason they haven't anything is because we don't have the ability to. The conditions there are too extreme for even our technology to withstand and like what I am going to discuss in the next paragraph it would take decades to develop that technology.

The last reasons I don't think the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet is not even liveable. Throughout the article the author constantly talks about how extreme the environment is, how it could basically kill any humans with it's gas and heat, and we would still need decades od innovations to even think about even sending something there. If we even developed that technology we would have to prove it to be safe as well. It took us years to even send people to the moon and people STILL die while in space just for common reasons.

In conclusion, we may be the twin to Venus but it will take us years and years and years to even get close to sending man or even things to Venus because of the enviromental issues. Venus is unliveable and most things would never survive there for long periods of time. We also have no put any time and effort to really discover Venus and other things to help get us to explore Venus. For these reasons that I have stated above, I conclude that the author does not support the idea that ""That studying venus i s a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" ",0
"I believe that students should have an B average or higher to participate in after school sports or activities because many students fail school or have under a 3.0 G.P.A. and they believe when they grow up the will become a basket ball player or a football player and don't think highly of their own education. They think when they grow up they will become a rich and famous athlete or an artist but they don't understand why they need a an education to do so. Most schools have a rule that you must have a 2.0 or higher to do sports or activities after school and that is one of the only reasons most children decide to work at all is to be able to take these pleasures after school. Students will understand that having a B average or higher grants you these after school festivities.

One day the child that grew playing a sport such as basketball is going to go out for the NBA and there's only one spot left but the person next to them is much more talented and gets the spot, they have nothing to fall back on they don't have the knowledge to know what to do next. But when they where in school and did after school activities and sports and kept that B average they learned something along the way and they learned what to do next. They had a plan if plan A did not work because they had kept that B average and learned they may even have gained more struggling to be on say the track team then just going to school and coming home. The back up plan is what will create are future doctors, lawyers, inventors and scientists. That is why i would argue with the principal if he/she decided to change the grading policy to B average to do after school activities or sports.",0
"Dear , Principal

Some student like doing community services for there community and some students think its a waste of time i' m going to try to persuade you to encourage all students to at least 100 community hours .

Student should be encouraged to take community hours because instead of them going home and just start watching t. v or play video games like 95% of the students do when they home and do that for the rest of day they can be out helping the community they can go to a school and tutor kids or go help clean up the local park or at least help with something.

Another reason why students should be encouraged to participate in community services because instead of the 10% out students out there are doing drugs and ruining the community they can be helping it by help clean up the litter they find in the street and to help stop polluting the water sources they have and try to get a petition to get a car pool lane on the highway to help stop air pollution.

My 3rd & final reason that student should be encourage to do community service hours because they may think that because you help the community you might get a reward of money or something that wont matter because the most best important reward that you know you helped your community become a better place to learn , keep safe and live.

In conclusion these where my main reasons why all students in school should be encouraged to do community services.      ",0
"In the article ""unmasking the face on mars"" people believe that the ""face"" was from a alien living on the planet mars. Garvin a NASA worker says that the picture shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or Mesa. Garvin also says that these kinds of landforms are common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho says Garvin. In chapter 12 it says "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars"". Everyone are beliveing what every one else is saying accept nobody is listening to what the scentists are saying from NASA.

In paragraph 5 it says that some people think the face is a bonda fide evidence of life on mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorista. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancident civilation on mars. Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars global surveyor known as (MGS) arrived at the red planet in september 1997. Eighteen years after the Viking Missions ended. Most of the NASA scientists believe that these faces are not from aliens there from the earth. Scientists have done studies and research these things unlike other people so everyone should be listening to the Scientists instead of other people who don't know anything about these markings.",0
"I think students should be required to do community service. Its a great way to appreciate the Earth, but also a good way to teach. For example, some students may like to go outside and get involved. Its a new experience of studying. Personally i love doing hands-on work, such as projects and building things.

The advantages are helping the planet and doing things for others. It makes an individual feel like they achieved something, it makes them feel good and have courage. community service is a great way to learn. You can get more involved, outside of school. You can get to know your neighbors or, who knows, you may just be a natural and open a window to a new career you never would think of. It'll give us knowledge that may be necessary in the future! Students should always keep an opened mind and take risks. Even if they don't like ""helping"", they should at least try it out. They wont know it, until they try it!

Now there are only a few flaws with this. For one, if its winter and you go outside, students may not like the cold weather (not likely), or maybe some students would not like the subject, or idea, of actually getting up, working and moving. Some may think its too boring or they don't want to tutor children. Doing community service may take time away from doing homework or take time away from activities we do outside of school

Overall, it depends on the person if they volunteer to help their community. But, I think its a great idea and we should do it. It'll be a new experience that'll somehow make me wiser and apply that knowledge later on in life.

"The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. Why is this important well beacuse people want to know about more about the picture or of what the picture is showing for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious. You can change that with new tecnology. Comperters are very helpful theses days in many ways. For example it can be useful for making payments , searching up information you need , paperwork, photoshop, diffrent apps that are useful on making your life better. Its a better sorce of seaching stuff up learning more about the world and the physics. Theres more to this i mostly use it for searching up information about the topic i want to learn about. Its easier for me beacuse i dont like rreading alot and i can just look up videos instead of having to sit there for an hour looking up information or reading it beacuse reading makes me sleepy. Thats why i think the web is an awsome resorse for people that need to be informed and thought many diffrent things.

Many people use this method by making there photogrophy work look better than it is. Its a very good sorce for people that have the job as a photographer beacuse they will make everything work in many ways. For example if something in the picture gets in the way the computer will show u how to get rid or it instead of doing all the extra stuff on taking a whole lot of pictures that look the same or worst. Why waist your time on doing that instead get the app or the program and get to steping its way better and easier to get pictures that are perfect.",0
"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced delegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definite winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winnertakeall"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the candidates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swinglike tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.",0
"Phones & Driving

Texting and driving is a major issue today. Although most people own and operate cell phones daily, there is a time and a place that they should be used, and while driving or operating another vehicle isn't one of them. People should not be able to text and drive because it causes accidents, it is a distraction, and it can seriously injure or even kill you or someone else.

Texting and driving can cause accidents. Many people think they can multitask, which leads them to believe that they can text and drive. This is incredibly dangerous especially since it has been scientifically proven that it is impossible to multitask. ""Trying more than one thing at a time - especially anything potentially dangerous, like texting while driving - seriously compromises our ability to complete the tasks safely and well. Equally important, repeatedly switching back and forth from project to project, like a hummingbird darting from flower to flower and then back to the original flower, can impair our ability to function at our finest."" According to https://health. clevelandclinic. org/science-clear-multitasking-doesnt-work/ .

Texting while driving is also a distraction from driving. This can be very dangerous because if you are distracted while driving you are most likely not driving safely. This can not only put yourself in danger but others as well. Even simply changing the song on your phone can put you in danger. While driving you should be completely focused on the task at hand, driving.

Finally, texting and driving not only puts you and others in danger, it can seriously injure or even kill. There have been countless news stories about people who were texting and driving and they got in an accident and died. We need to prevent this especially since a lot of those people were teens. Teens are especially at risk for this because we have a hard time putting the phone down in class let alone in the car.

In conclusion, I believe we should not be able to text and drive because a lot of people can barely text and walk. Even though owning and operating phones is a daily activity, there is definitely a time and a place for them to be used.    ",0
"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.

One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.

Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.

Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.

Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.",0
"There are many limiting car usage, through out the world, many are in the suburb of germany. some are also in Bogota. And many more countrys like the United states.

In the first passage, it has some car limiting usage. the country that it resigns in  the suburbs of germany. For an example "" automobiles are linchpin of the suburbs where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai  tend to make thier homes."" ""Experments said that there is a drastically reduce greenhouse gas emision from the tailpipes. It also states that the passager cat are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas  emissions in Europe. And up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the united states."" ( Rosenthal, paragraph 5) So thats a limiting car usage. Because  the greenhouse percentage is going up in many countries  mainly Europe and the United States.

Thats just not it, The united states has been the worlds prime car cultures.  ""Its also the birthplace of the model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilsom Pickett immortalized ""Mustanf Sally"""" "" Demographic shifts in the driving population  suggest that the tend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in percentage of 16-to 39 years olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain thier licenses as they age"" Mr. Sivaks research has found. (paragraph 39) In New York , there is  a ""proliferation of car-sharing programs acroos the nation"" (paragraph 37)  there are many car limiting advantages like is stated above  car-sharing that was devolped in New  York and now travling all over the United States. There are many elder people reatinging their license. And less younger people getting thier licenses.

In the end, there are many advantages, going through the United States in to Europe. Those are some of the advantages of limiting car usage.    ",0
"What do you think about when you think of the future? Do you think that driveless cars would be the end result of being safe? Driveless cars are not safe because it makes people lazy, gets rid of all driving laws, and technology isn't always as great as we think it is.

The world is already lazy, so why would you want to make it more lazy? We already have machines, computers, and phones doing everything for us. Machines make everyday things but people get paid so much for pressing a button. Computers do everything for us. Phones answer all our questions. Now cars are going to be driving themselves. And what are the people going to do? Sit back and watch. Then all we will be doing is having everything do it for us and we do nothing.

Not only will the people be lazy, then there will not be laws like there is today. What is someone gets hurt? Who are you going to blame it on? People do what they do and how they do it for a reason. If people want to drunk drive and drive high then they should be punished for the bad things they do and not have a car doing everything for them and be as if it's a way out of trouble.

Now that there isn't much laws and we have robots doing everything for us there is only one thing we depend on. That is technology. Technology isn't the greatest. Have you ever got mad while being on a computer or a phone? Why is that? It's because technology didn't work as well that day. What are you going to do when you're in a driveless car and it decides to just stop? You're going to get hurt. Now you're hurt and no one is reliable because we thought technology was the greatest thing.

All in all, driveless cars are not safe for today's society. They are not safe because it makes people lazy, laws will be cut in half, and technology doesn't always work. We're here to make something of our lives and not have technology do everything for us. So go out and have a life.          ",0
"What are the advantages of limiting car use? Eventhough cars are a really fast way to get from one place to another there are many other ways for example a train,air plane or boat. There are too many cars on the streets and many crazy drivers. People should stop using cars because cars make greenhouse gas and it's causing the air to be polited. Another advantage for limiting car use is that less people are going to be geting killed because of car axcidents or because of drunck drivers. Also if people stoped driving cars aand tok there bike to work or were ever they go more people would be in shape becuase they would be doing some excersice too.

Too many cars on the steets are poluting the air and thats not good for us because we are cutting down trees and we are going to run out of air to breath at some point if we continue like this. Thats why poeple should stop driving cars and ride a bike to there job or take the train. Also cars make geenhouse gas, cars are responsible for 12 persent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. We are also going to have less death because many people die in car axcidents and becuase of drunk drivers and less kids are going to be getting hurt or killed if there on the street because they dont have to worry about cars hitting them. For example if a kid is playing with a ball and the ball goes to the street the kid is probably going to go get it but he wont get hurt because there are no cars on the streets.

Eventhough cars cause greenhouse gas, air polution and death they are also very help full because if you have to go late at night to get food you have a fast way to get to the market because u have a car right out side your door. Also if something happens to your son in school or if u or someone needs medical attention you have a fast way to take them to the hospital or to get to were they are. But theres a down side if you go out to see what happend to you son in a hurry you probably going to have a car axcident and get seriously hurt or worst. Too many people use too many cars the streets are always crouded with cars at all times and some of these people drive crazy or they try to show of there car by going fast and end up getting killed or killing someone els.

This are some of the advantages of limiting car use less people would die,we would have more air to breath, and there would be less green house gas effect. And i think think that it is a good idea to stop using cars and take your bike to work because you would be helping earth and will be getting some exersice at the same time. And you would also be helping to to save earth and have a better future for you kids. Well this is what i think but what do u think?    ",0
"Many people believe that the 'Face on Mars' was formed by aliens. What do you think? If you were told that the face on Mars was created by aliens, what would you do? What would you say? I know what I would do. I would call them crazy and explain to them that aliens do not exsist and that it was a fact of science.

The 'Face on Mars' is a natural landform. The light from the sun is shone across the landform to make it look like it has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth like a human person, but, if you were to create an exact copy of Mars, put on a different scale, hold it still, and shine light at the exact angle of the sun, you would see that the sun is what really causes the 'Face on Mars' to appear to look the way it does.

Aliens, if they exsisted, could not have created something so magnificent and perfect that at that angle it would look like a face. Scientists have studied the geography of Mars for years and have had nothing to say about aliens. They have prooven their facts and have given us reason to believe that this was simply the way Mars was stuctured and that the rays of the Sun are the cause of it looking like a face.

If aliens did create the 'Face on Mars', why would our scientist have not discovered them? Why havent we ever then seen one before? For those that believe that it was aliens that sculpted Mars, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Mars was naturally formed and can never and will never be changed by aliens because aliens simply do not exsist.

So, for all of those out there in our lovely world that think that aliens do infact exsist and that they somehow, over millions of years created a 'Face on Mars', I would like to say one last thing on my behalf, aliens do not exsist and could not have created something so mindblowing. ",0
"Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I believe it would be a great idea to require all students to perform community service, doing this would cause our community and the world to be a better place.

For example, if just a mere 25 students would help pick up trash around SCHOOL_NAME everyday, our community would be so much cleaner.

And, if our community is that much cleaner, the more likely less birds would tragically die due to mistakenly eaten trash, and less sea life would die from being suffocated from plastic bags and six pack can holders.

If older or more educated students were willing to tutor, or mentor younger or less educated students, then our school and community might all just be a bit smarter.

In this case, it would help out the teachers as well as the parents. Not everyone can necessarily afford a Math, English, History, or Science tutor.

So, if a more educated student is willing to help out that could keep from kids failing tests, not turning in homework, and maybe even passing a class.

If more SCHOOL_NAME students helped feed homeless families, build houses in Mexico, or maybe even just read a book to a younger child who can't read, this community would be better!

Some people need food, some need a place to live, and some might just want a story read to them.

But all of this is counted as community service.

ALL of it helps our community, and makes it a better place.

In conclusion, if you require all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME to perform a certain number of community service hours, our community WILL be a better place. I can promise that.

Community service is a very important thing, it helps the community and can even change the world. Simply one person can make a HUGE difference on this planet.

Imagine how big of a difference 1,300 students can make.

"Scientists are striving to meet the challenge of exploring the dangerous planet of Venus. Scientist believe that long ago Venus may have supported various forms of life. Looking up at Venus from Earth is a safe distance to visualize the planet since it is very challenging to examine it more closely. The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. These dangers include the enviroment, but it is worthy pursuit becuase it part of human curiosity, and innovation.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth. This pressure can crush a submarine. The temperature can liquefy many metals. Venus has eurpting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Venus is now an inhospital to any form of life.

Human curiosity drives scientist eagerly to explore this planet despite of the many danger is upholds. Many scientist believe that Venus could have a been able to support life long time ago. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus. In paragraph 7 it states tha ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all "".

In conclusion there are many challenges that make things difficult to explore Venus. There is a purpose to explore Venus. NASA is trying to still pursuit solutions to these challenges so that human might actually have a chance to explore this dangerous but amazing planet. So when you look up at the ""Evening Star"" just think about the fasicnating planet that once might have supported life but also remind yourself that this is now a hostile planet that scientist hope that someday they can explore.",0
"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. Some of my friends do community service like tutoring younger children or cleaning up litter in parks. Others do not want to do community service because they feel it takes up too much of their free time to do other things. I on the other hand disagree with them. I'm sure you disagree also. I feel we should have students be required to perform community service as a requirement to graduate from high school. I think this because for one thing it would help out our community a lot and we would feel good about ourselves when we know we did a good thing.

I understand why some kids would not want to do community service because they may want to have fun doing other things with their friends or have a busy life. But that is no reason to not help out the community for one day! Lets say a group of kids wants to go to the park and play. When they get there the ground is covered in litter, so they leave and have nothing else to do. That is why we need to have students be required to do community service, so we will have clean parks to play in.

If every student in high school just volunteered for one weekend of community service the whole town and the citizens living in it would have a much better life. The citizens would have cleaner fairgrounds, nicer roads and sidewalks, and their sons and daughters would be more educated, if the students tutored them! The students would only have to do that much for the requirement, but they could do more if they would like.

In conclusion I think you should have community service be a requirement for all high school students for them to be able to graduate! I think this because it would make our community a safer, happier, and cleaner place to live in! I hope you take that into consideration.

"Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Cell phones are simply too distracting even for the most talented enough most experienced driver enough to drive and chew gum. I feel like Unless Bluetooth is built into the car and designed to operate as a vehicle accessory much like a radio or windshield washer control I done see a problem with being on the phone while driving because it is hands free.

But we are being our own worst enemies when it comes to driving while on the phone it is Hard to that everyone knows at least one accident caused by using a cell phone while driving even if you can walk and chew gum at the same time, gum chewing is an unconscious activity. Talking on a phone and driving are not. People who think they are as alert talking on a cell phone and driving are probably the same people who think one, two or three drinks doesn't dumb down their driving skills.

I follow many drivers, of all ages, who start slowing down considerably or start swerving in traffic and there are not even young like me they are older people that could be the age of my parents that are driving reckless while on the phone like when they are looking for their phones to answer them, to call someone, or to text someone. This causes braking from everyone else that causes unnecessary crashes from everyone else. Cell phone use and driving is a distraction no matter who is doing it. I it doesn't matter how many years' experience that person has driving. You are not going to drive a car while talking on a cell phone in drivers ed, so why do it on the road with real citizens not cones? Next time you're talking on a cell phone and driving, once you hang up, try remembering how many stop lights you just went thru.         ",0
"Do you think that the Electoral College prosses is practical? Do you think that it is okay for someone else to vote for us? Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voting and electing a president. Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process, it it outdated and not accurate, also the electors have proven to be untrustworthy in the past.

Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a candidate wants to win presidency, heshe has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors. Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidential election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes. Some people argue that the Electoral College is trustworthy, but how are my fellow Americans expected to trust a group of people who have betrayed us before?

Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it. Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any sense to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win! Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.

Don't you think that it is great to live in a free county where the citizens make the rules, and what is in the best interest of the people is what is taken into consideration more than what the government wants? Well, the Electoral College isn't what ""we the people"" want. We want to be able to choose who we elect, not another group of people. Some may argue that the electoral congress is good because if two candidates get the same amount of popular votes, the Electoral Congress acts as a tie breaker, but I'm sure that we can find a better way to break the tie than having untrustworthy people decide the fate of our homeland.

This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.",0
"Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because extracurricular activities are beneficial to the mind and body. For example, if someone joins a soccer team they will be more physically active. If someone joined a soccer team, they would also be better at working with other people. Or if someone joined debate club, it would improve there debate skills. If someone joined debate club, it might also make them feel more confident. Forcing students to do at least one extracurricular activity would also benefit students, because then students will meet new people.

Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because students might learn new skills. For example, if someone joined a basketball team, they will most likely improve in basketball. Also, if a student joined clay club, there art skills will most likely improve. Or, if a student joined a baseball team, there skills in baseball will most likely improve. This is why it is better for students to learn new things, rather than not learn anything new by staying at home.

Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because they will meet new people. For example, if a student joined track, they will probably meet new people. Also, if a student joined lacrosse, they would probably meet new people. Or, if a student joined science Olympiad, they will probably meet new people. It is good for students to meet new people, because they might make new friends.

Students should be forced to do at least one extracurricular activity, because team sports, would probably improve students teamwork skills. For example, if a student joined lacrosse, it would probably improve there teamwork skills because in lacrosse you have to have good communication to win the game. Also, if a student joined a volleyball team, there teamwork skills would probably improve, because in volleyball you have to tell your team you are going to hit the ball. Or, if a student joined a hockey team, there teamwork skills would probably improve, because your team has to have good communication to win, for example you have to know if someone on your team is trying to hit the puck to you. It is important that students have good teamwork skills, because teamwork skills are not just important in sports, but teamwork skills are also important when you have to do a class project with your group.

students should be forced to join at least one extracurricular activity, because students get a lot of benefits from joining extracurricular activities. For example, students will learn new skills by doing extracurricular activities. Also, students will meet new people by doing extracurricular activities. Students teamwork skills would also improve. It is much better for students to get all these benefits by doing extracurricular activities, rather than not doing any extracurricular activates and not learning anything new.",0
"Reisdents of VAUBAN that are car owners are allowed to park in two places in a large garage. alos at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. some of the citizens where not to happy about the plan of having no car almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to reuters 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

At the Mobile World conress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chir man of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a bsiness plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. he proposed partnering with the telecommunications inustry to create cities in which pedestian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportaion traffic are woven into a cconneted network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.

Levittown and Scarsdale, Newy York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of thw 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.                                                                    ",0
"My thoughts on driverless cars are not necessarily against it but I think the world can do without for awhile still, in other words there's no rush to get them out into the public streets. Although it would be very luxurious to have a car the drives itself, the safety issues & tedious appliances still need much work. Google has had driverless cars since 2009 that drove more than half a million miles without crashing but these cars still require human occupation in complicated traffic situations & driveways. I think the smart road system working in hand with the driverless cars would be more efficient but too expensive & requires ""massive"" upgrades to the roads so the idea was disgarded. So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating senor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standardly & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of in-car entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer-driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets. ",0
"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any run-off elections. Run-off elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that  the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The resonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.                                                    ",0
"Dear Senator,

I think we should change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. It seems very unfair to the president who got the most votes from the citizens but lost the votes of the Electoral College. If the majority of the citizens voted for president 1 but president 2 won then a lot of people will be upset. It will cause many things to happen. It's better to have just a few hundered people upset than a few thousand people mad. Either way someone will be upset, but which would you rather?

In some states, more people may vote one president 2 so all the votes for president 1 won't be counted. Those few votes for president 1 could have made a change in the popular votes. It may not seem like they would make a change but it will. Yes those votes will be on the presidency votes but the Electoral College votes will be the votes that make the diference.

People vote for the president that they believe will help them and the whole United States in a positive way. Imagine living when schools were segregated and you wanted to desegregate schools. One president offers to keep segregation in schools and the other president offers to desegregate. You would vote for the second president, right? Then that president won the presidency votes but lost the votes for the Elector College. You, like many others who chose the same president, would be upset. The schools will stay segregated. Many arguments about desegregation may start. If the Electoral College didn't exist then a lot of people would be happier. The schools would be desegregated. Everyone, no matter what color their skin is, would have an equal opportunity to education.                                             ",0
"There is a lot of discussion whether or not to keep the Electoral College. The electoral college is the process in which we vote for our next president. It was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers, which was a really long time ago. So why do we still use the Electoral College? The Electoral College is completely outdated. We need to get rid of the Electoral College now!

Why are we still using the Electoral College to vote? It's extremely confusing. What if you vote for the wrong elector? That sometimes happens which is unfair to voters. We should be able to just directly vote for the president we want. If we could just vote for the president we want, not the electors, it would be so much simpler. Why confuse the citizens of the U.S. when you could just make things easier for us? The Electoral College is a way to confusing process to vote for our president. It's time to update the way we vote.

People think they're voting for the president, but really, they're just voting for electors. That is completely unfair. Why not just vote for the president of your choice? The citizens cannot always control who the electors vote for. How unfair would that be if the elector you chose, decided to vote for the president you didn't want? Also, the electors can be just anyone. They can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on what state you're in, either the state conventions, the states party central committee or even the presidential candidates can pick the electors. Why even bother going through all that trouble when you could just vote for the president you want? It's way more easier.

There are so many things that could go wrong when using the Electoral College process to vote. What if there is a tie in the electoral votes? Then who does the state choose? That would throw everyone off guard. Why have to even worry about that when you could just vote the president of your choice? It's ridiculous that we still use the Electoral College to vote. Also, we could choose the wrong elector when voting and that would really make people mad.

The Electoral College is outdated, confusing, and just way to complicated. Why go through the trouble of having to make sure you vote for the right elector, when you could just vote for the president of your choice. It's completely irrational how we still use the Electoral College to vote. You're not voting for the president you want, but for electors to choose the president. You can't always control who the electors vote for. There are a handful of things that could go wrong. We just need to get rid of the Electoral College once and for all.",0
"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years. More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline. In Robert buffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with. In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars. The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage. In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""Duffer 16 This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel. Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket. Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment. In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.SRosenthal 5. This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars. By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs. A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bikesharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.Rosenthal 37"" A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that. The encouragement of governments to suggest carpooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls. If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road. Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.Rosenthal 40 Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once. With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year. Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.Selsky 20By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars. With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road. Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored. Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.Rosenthal 35 Because of this, people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family. This has created a domino effect people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society. They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues. By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.",0
"In some schools, summer projects are assigned to assure that students will continue learning well after the school year ends. Although students should continue to learn during their break, some have argued that if the projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed is the better option because students will have more options to chose from, they can do a project they're interested in, and teacher-designed projects are annoying to produce.

Many teachers would complain that students won't have any directions to follow on their projects and will thus not continue learning during their break. Although, students not having any directions on how to make their projects is true. This can be viewed as a purely subjective point, since this'll give students more freedom on how they want their projects to be. Another point of discussion is is that students won't continue to further learn during their break. This viewpoint that students won't continue to learn is wrong due to the fact that students will be learning while creating their projects.

Having more options for students to choose from is great because students can create a project of something they're interested in with high effort. In the past, teachers would only give students one option for a project idea; therefore, limiting the chance of something that student would interested in and lowering the effort. For example, if a student was given the freedom to write about a certain sport they're interested in, they could make a well informed slide show to present to a class or could talk forever about their favorite team in a podcast. A student would choose to write something they're interested rather than having to read a long book than having to write a big essay any day.

Students can make projects more enjoyable is a valid point because it can show their creativity. Since students won't have any directions on how to make their projects, they can be as creative as they want. They can try out new ways to present projects like showing a cool infographic or make a fun video that can inform a class about a topic they worked on. This could make the actual work process of the project more enjoyable to the student and whoever they're presenting it too.

The third reason why student-designed is the better option is because teachers can make projects annoying for the students. Teachers can sometimes make students go out of their way to work on their projects. To include, teachers can make it so students have to visit somewhere to get information to further continue working on their projects or make students have to buy certain books to write about. This may not seem so bad at first glance; however, for some students who go visit out of the country for the majority of the break can be a nightmare for them. Imagine a student being gone for the majority of the break just to come back and only have a little less than week to visit a musesum and write an essay about it. This situation shows how teachers make projects annoying for these types of students.

In conclusion, a student-designed project is better because students can choose what they want to talk about, projects would be more enjoyable for everyone, and students won't have to go out of their way from teacher-designed projects. Having more freedom in options leads to students picking something they're interested in.

Students also show their creativity thus making it more enjoyable. finally, teachers make students go out of their way for projects; therefore, making it annoying for some students who travel.",0
"Dear Principle,

I have been informed that you are a bit shaky on the decision to make community service a requirement to the student body or not. Well, I believe that it would be a splendid opportunity for the students to assist people and really just feel the joy of helping others. Also i think it would help students stay on the right track in their lives and not get dragged into drama and all the non since that goes on in schools these days. Plus i bet that the students will come to like the fact that they are really making a difference in our community. Think about it this way, the students of your school being on the front cover of the newspaper for cleaning up the beach. They could also volunteer at a nursing home and just help the older people around, talk to them, and just make them feel loved. I mean if i was in an older folks home and i didn't get visited very often and these really happy, smiley children came to visit me it would totally make my day. I really believe with all my knowledge that this idea of yours is going to be very beneficial to the community and to your student body!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"Is answering a cell phone call worth losing your life over? How about reading to a text? Using your cell phone while driving is very dangerous. I looking away from the road for one second can cause car accidents or maybe even kill someone. can cause a car accident just looking away just to look at your child for just a second you look away can cause an accident. There have been millions of deaths coming from having car accident having your phone out while driving or even being on your cell phone can cause a car accident.

Cell phone use while driving leads to many crashes. There are reported 1.6 million each year. Teen driver's cell phone use has led to the most car accidents. According to 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. Injuries by just sending one text can cause a car accident as according to general cell phone statistics use of cell phones and driving becomes a problem and increase of an accident in the year of 2016 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected, were 20 years ago, cell phones were not a problem and there was not as many car accidents as there are now.

Texting while driving has caused so many car accidents 1 out of 4 car accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. Using cellphones while driving is very dangerous and have killed millions of people in the world sending just one quick text can cause a car accident is that really worth it? Killing yourself or killing somebody else just because you didn't wait to send a text in 2017 3,166 people were killed by texting while driving. and driving while children are in the car you should most definitely should wait to send a text because when somebody gets in the car with you and you are driving you are responsible for that person's life.

The National Safety Council reports nearly 390,000 injuries are caused just from texting and driving is not safe at all when a driving is listening to a conversation or music the brain power. he or she dedicates to driving decreased by 40% and another thing drivers talking on the phone cause the most car accidents. even just dialing a phone number can cause an accident just looking at your child can just for 2 seconds can cause an accident. or just looking down at your phone to see whos calling you it takes time to get into a car accidents it's very important that you pay close attention to the road and not just you other drivers too.

I believe that drivers should not use cell phones while driving. Because texting while driving can cause car accidents. And can cause bad injury you can kill yourself and other people lives when you get behind that wheel. it's a must you pay close attention to the road and keep your eyes on the road at all times cause a car accident can happen in just one second and then boom now your in a wreck just because you want to look down at your phone.

"By limiting car usage, research has shown there is less greenhouse gas emissions, a promotion in alternative transportation, and can result in a new and improved safe society.

To begin, the advantages of limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution that is emitted into the air, resulting in a more environmental friendly neighborhood. According to research in Vauban, Germany, ""...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Source 1 Many locations around the world are taking this act into perspectiveincluding not only Vauban,Germanybut also Paris,France, Bogota,Colombia, and even cities in the United States that are reducing these numbers drastically and making a beneficial change in the environment. ""If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions."" Next, with the declining usage of cars, citizens are left with alternative transportation that are beneficial. Many people have gone from driving carsgetting from point A to point Bto visiting parks and sports centers, which can lead to an increase in physical activity. Another advantage to giving up your car can also lead to less traffic. According to the new routine in Colombia, ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.""Source 3 In Paris, officials are enforcing drivers to clear the air of the global city with a partial driving ban. With this new ban in play, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France."" Source 2 Since the change, public transit from Friday to Monday was free of charge. As you can see, these changes are coming into effect and are changing the world in various positive ways.

Heidrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this wayreferring to giving her car up. Source 3 Businessman Carls arturo Plaza also says, ""This is a good opportunity to reduce stress and lower air pollution."" Source 3 In addition, the reduction of car usage leads to a safer environment. According to my. Sivak's research, ""There has been a large drop in the pecentage of 16 to 39yearolds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age.""Source 4 A study found that driving by young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. With this evolutionary change in peoples everyday lives, many large numbers are drastically going down, revealing numerous advantages. The number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak, the rates of car ownership per household and per person has started to come down two to three years before the downturn, and demographic shifts in the driving population all reveal that people may find less reason to resume to their cardriven habits.

To conclude, the limiting of car usage can improve the environent, can result in numerous transportation opportunities, and can lead to a safer society.",0
"Many schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their summer brake. Do you think they should be Student-designed or teacher-designed?. They should be student-designed because it gives students a chance to be creative,they can learn something they are interested in,and finally lets them have fun with their projects during the summer.

Although some people may argue that letting the students choose their own projects would lead to them either not doing it or to them choosing the easiest subject and finishing it in a day or two,But there are other view points to consider.

First,Letting students choose their own projects will let them be creative. A lot of students like to stand out and be different from the rest of their peers. As many people know not every student is the same and not every student thinks the same way. So they should let the students express themselves in their projects and even teachers will get to see a whole other side to their students that they never knew they had. For example,every artist in the world are expressing them selves everyday with their art and millions of people love it,and do you think that a teacher assigned that art work to them?.

Secondly,Students will be able to work on something they are interested in. Many schools and teachers force kids into learning something they dont want to learn or have not interest in and that is why they dont retain any of the information. I understand that not every subject they need will catch there attention but when it comes to something they have a choice in learning most kids will choose what they are really interested in. Why? because we as people don't like it when someone tells us we have to learn this or do this assignment and when they do they are not going to do it with effort,why,because they don't like it or have interest in it. When they let the student choose what they want to learn then they will do it with passion and lost of interest because they like the subject and really want to learn more about and so they will try their best and they will learn new things about a subject that they never knew before. For example,Kaka was one of the greatest soccer players in the world,winning many champions of Europe and many others,and his parents were lawyers and wanted him to become oneas well but he had no interest in it. No matter how much his parents tried he didnt find interest in it until he started playing soccer and he loved with a passion and so his parents let him do that. So letting their son do something that he found interest in it led him to become one of the greatest soccer player the world has ever seen.

Finally,it lets the students have a little fun with their projects and during the summer. Now these students are still kids and still need to have fun during their summer brake because they did jest go thought months of learning and when they finally get out they have to learn even more. Plus if the project is teacher-designed then they are going to feel like they are back in school but if they choose what they wanna do for their project then they can have fun while doing it. Like i said in the above argument they will be learning something they have interest in and you never know with kids they can come up with some weirdest and funnest things for their projects. They are able to do many experiments for their projects when they dont feel obligated to do it and can jest do fun things that get it done.

In Conclusion,summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students a chance to be creative,they can learn something they are interested in,and finally lets them have fun with their projects during the summer. because of the reasons listed here,Students should choose there summer project. also these kids are our country's future and they need to know that expressing themselves is ok and letting people know what they want is also important. Thank you for considering my view points.",0
"Dear,TEACHER_NAME

I think your new plan to keep kids from playing sports or other extracurricular activities is outrages. Kids like myself play sports and other activities ti find a way our of the daily stress of school and social drama might i add. It is ridiculous that you should withhold things that we cherish the most in order for us to have to take on more work then what is usually some of us may have learning disabilities or we do the work and the teacher doesn't answer our questions in class to the full extent. Have you thought of an alternative then just take away our escape from reality these activities are keeping us from running the streets like a bunch of hood rats and hoodlums.

I think you should think of an alternative then just to take away what our means of therapy is maybe one day out of the week we could not practice and just do a study hall. Or you may just sit us out for a game or the 1st quater/first half to motivate us to do better and achieve better in ourselves. Some of us may just be to depressed or mad to simply just try to bring up our grades if we cant ensure that we will play.

In conclusion on the behalf of the student body at SCHOOL_NAME i think you should fine another way to motivate us to bring our education to a higher level.

"I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. All in all school help as to learn.",0
"Dear principal this new policy that you have made is not right. some of our best athletes have a C average so by making the eligible grades higher to a B average you will be destroying our sports program. If you chose to fallow your policy then the whole sport program and all the school are going on a strike. We the students will stop making good grades.

By dropping our grades than we will make the school look bad. you will be the one affected because you are the one incharged of the students doing good and not dropping their grades. After dropping our grades you still decide to fallow your policy then we will slowly stop coming to school. We will all transfer out of the school and attend another school that has a sport C eligible program. Also if there is a low number of students that are coming to the school than the school board will have to shut the school down. After the school shuts down then you will have to lose your job. After you lose your job the students will beg the school board to reopen the school just with a different principal that is under a condition of not l higher the eligible average.

So that as long as your passing all your classes with at least C average then you can be participating in any sport you feel like playing.",0
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy dispute despite the dangers very efficiently and clearly. They clearly explain the argument in the second paragraph. They also properly list all the advantages to exploring Venus and then weighed it out with the challenges and risks that would stand in the way. They finally finish by stating their claim once more in their concluding paragraph.

To start their article, they begin in paragraph 2 by stating some facts about the planet and a bit of history to go into it, which helps us understand Earth's history with Venus itself. In Paragraph 2, it states, ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours... ...not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. "" This explains that we have tried to land spacecrafts onto Venus to study the planet before, and have failed, therefore causing us to give up until now, which is where our argument comes into play.

The argument for this article is simply ""Should we try to study Venus again?"" and the author believes we should, after they weighed out some of the challenges that were in our way then and are in our way now. Paragraph 3 states ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" These facts are about the surface of the planet, and as the author also states in paragraph 3, ""these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and liquefy any metals.""

The author then asks at the beginning of paragraph 4, ""if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" Then proceeds to explain, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This explanation tells us that Venus could have been exactly like Earth, and may even still be in certain ways. Their explanation continues with, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" Using this information, we could theoretically use Venus as a second Earth, or maybe a pitstop on the way to other planets, or as a way to research for other lifeforms, which is worth the risks that come with it, and that's what the author is trying to say when asking, ""The Value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?""

The author explains that, ""The... ...Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The author continues to go on and explain that NASA has a plan to make a vehicle that would hover over Venus and observe from above, where the conditions would be less severe. they continue, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that their solution would be managable, but not perfect.

For their final paragraph, they restate their claim, saying ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This proves that they believe it will lead us further if we listen to our curiosity versus when we don't follow through due to risks. They also state ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" which backs up their claim.

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that Policy 1; Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is the best policy to use. I believe this policy is the best because would you rather allow us to have them and use them when we can and allowed too or sneak behind your back and use them all day long to text or call people? I think that by not allowing us to bring them will cause us to rebel more and use them during class time, lunch time and virtually all day long, when if you let us use them we will obey the rule and respect you by actually letting us use them so then we will listen and we will know you understand we are actually obsessed with them. The reason i think this is because if a kid is very sick and no one believes him, he can call his parent/ guardian during a time he will be able to use his phone and his the person he calls will come get him during school hours so the next day he is not sick because he did not get proper care from the school when he needed it and he will come to school the next day. Another reason i think they should be used during free time only is because if all you do is talk to your friends during free time you have nothing else to do, you can play around with your cell phone so we are not disturbing you and annoying the class and most of all the teachers. One more reason i think Policy 1 is a good policy is because by you actually letting us use our phones and trusting us to know that we will only use our phone during the time you want us too, it will make us have more respect for you and let us know that you trust us enough to obey the rules and not use them at any other time then free time. I also believe that if you do not let us use phones during school we will be more tempted to use them and pull them out during class to text or call people. These are just some of the many reasons I think Policy 1 is the best policy for you to chose when picking one or the other. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

"The long list of benefits that comes from limited car usage are mostly based on where you live and how much you do your part. Laws and restrictions have been arriving across the entire world to see the effects of having little or no automobiles in the community. Other countries that have an intense cloud of smog need to ban car use in the millions at a time to help settle down the atmosphere there.

Life without cars today can be very well described in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . In her article she describes how the community is shaped and condensed in order to make travelling to necessarry places easy through walking or bike riding distance. This is the kind of turn around that the world needs as well. With the amount of pollution happening, this is a good experiment that will hopefully spread all over the planet.

The amount of pollution affecting certain cities across the world is getting rather out of hand. In Robert Duffer's article

Paris bans driving due to smog , he talks about the intense pollution over France's capital, resulting in the partial ban of almost

HALF

of the amount of cars on the road at once. Those who violated the ban's rules were fined, and thousands of cars were impounded as well due the the reaction of citizens when they received the fine. In paragraph 14 of the article, Duffer states that ""

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France ,

after five days of intensifying smog.""

The ban clearly worked, showing that it was indeed the heavy number of vehicles on the road all at once.

Programs all across the world have gotten people in the millions to find other methods of travel that did not cause any pollution. Columbia is a huge example as shown in Andrew Selsky's article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . In the article, Selsky specifies about how millions of Columbians have taken alternative modes of transport, whether it be hiking, biking, or skating as opposed to general driving. Even on account of rain, the citizens found ways to get about without using their cars. This is making Bogota a more human and social place as well, as Selsky states, ""

Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.""

This event is happening for the good of the people and of the planet, and it seems like everyone is okay with that.

With the way our world is rapidly changing with a new generation and new technology, we are going to have to adapt from our old habits. Young adults are not seeing the full necessity of buying a vehicle when they can get to where they need to go by other means that are less expensive and less harmful to the environment. The need for everyone to have a car is slowly going down. It may never completely go away, but it is reducing greatly.    ",0
"Driving cars are something that many people are looking forewards to in the future. These driving cars are being invented and take alot of money to make. Some of the questions that you may ask yourself are how do they work, where will they work, and are they safe? I personally like the idea of having cars drive by themselves. The reason why is because ther wouldn't be that many accidents, people wouldn't have to worry about getting ran over, and if the driver is drunk or ill they wouldn't cause any wrecks.

They started to put these cars together in the late 1900's. In 1950 GM made a concept car that would run on a track with an electric cable that sent radio signals to the receiver on the front of the car. GM tried to imput these electric cables on the roads but it costed to much to remake the roads. They tried many different methods to make these cars drive but they didn't succed. Until around the year 2000 when technology was starting to advance and played a huge role in our society.

Now these cars have highly imputed sensors that help the car run and keep the driver alert if something malfunctions. These cars also have implied brakes to stop the car in an emergency and vibrating sensors to notify the driver that it needs human skill to help it. These sensors will help detect that something is wrong and to keep the car on the road. There would also be less accidents. Teens would have help from the car and parents help too and wouldn't get in many wrecks.

Finally these cars have pass certain laws and have certain laws put in order to put the cars on the road and also help if the driver gets in a wreck.. Driveless cars have to have a lot more technology imputed so in case of a major emergency it will be able to protect the driver and passengers in the car.

In conclusion many car companies are starting to make driveless cars so we have to be more opened minded and keep up with technology, because our world is going to be changed dramatically and we have to be ready for big changes. These cars are only the beginning of something big. That will change our society in the furture. So what are your thoughts about all this new information?

Are you for or aganist driveless cars?              ",0
"Phones And Driving

Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things a driver can do. It can cause major and serious wrecks. Why do people wreck when texting and driving ? The people who text and drive do not concentrate on the road or their surroundings.

Texting and driving is so common for causing most teen wrecks. Teens are new to driving and have little to no experience. Adding a phone to the mix is just a recipe that will cook disaster. It's not just new drivers who wreck from texting and driving its new ones too.

Everyone who texts and drives is putting themselves and others at risk. If you wreck due to texting and driving you will be held liable. Many people who text and drive can end up killing the other person they get into a wreck with. Ask yourself before you go and pick up your phone if it's worth the risk.

In most states it is illegal to text and drive. You can receive a big ticket if you get caught texting and driving. Bluetooth started being introduced into cars in 2011. Bluetooth helps drivers answer phone calls without holding the phone. In conclusion, texting and driving is illegal and should not be done.

"Dear Principle,

I think that all students should be active in the community and do community service.

I think they should because it helps you be active in the real world.

Also because it makes you active around others and helps people problem solve.

People who think the community doesn't help them is ridiculous if you didn't have a community then you wouldn't be playing sports or going to your community pool.

Also you see a lot of famous people saying "" I want to give back to my community"". They say that because their community does so much for them like encourage them and help the reach their dreams.

I wonder what kids think of when they say the community takes time from what I need or want to do.

What do the mean, if it wasn't for the community the wouldn't be doing anything.

Another reason why kids should do community service is because they are the future face of America so they need to help this country instead of sitting playing video games.

They also learn important life skills like leadership and responsibility.

If you help the community then you will lean these skills very easily.

Once kids start doing this then they will be glad they do it and be happy and feel great and also accomplished.

Kids don't know that the community really needs us and everyone needs to lend a hand or our country wont have good effective leaders in the future.

Also it is not just for out countries leaders it is just for regular people in the work fore need to help because every person makes a big difference.

The community is like a miniature world if people don't keep helping and do9iing work the it will be in a big slump just like the world can be in sometimes.

So I hope you take this letter in to consideration and please listen to my advice. Make the best decision possible and choose what you think is best.

People really need to help the community or it will not keep doing what is has been doing for decades now.

Think about how would you feel if the community you grew up in turned into nothing and everything was gone.

I don't want that to happen to mine.

So please make community service mandatory for everyone.

Thank you!!

"The author states this FACS machine can read emotions just by looking at someone is non-sense but this could be true. It decoded the facial emotions of the Mona Lisa and saying all her emotions just by looking at it, i wan't to beleive it can do that.

The author states that Mona Lisa is "" 83 percent happy, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The algerithym only gave us 91% of the Mona Lisa emotion what about the other 9%? The FACS machine reads your 44 major muscles to read your emotions which is amazing and kind of silly at the same time. This all the machine does but it could be helpful to figure out if someone is really upset about something going on, but it could have some draw backs to it. The FACS machine only read 91% of the Mona Lisa and i want to know the rest of it!

The positive aspect of the machine is that it could read emotions and facial muscles to see if the kid is thinking about suicide if it could do that. The FACS machine ""using video imagery, the new emotion-recognizer software tracks these facial movements."" This shows that FACS is devolping that one day could helps with emotions and other various life problems like helping us recognize friends that are going through a rough patch in their life. These sentences from the text "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actully describing each facial trait the conveys happy, worried etc."" If Dr. Huang devolps the FACS machine more to helps more with friends emotion when feeling down or even our parents if neccesary. This could have a huge impact for students because teachers can with problems in your just by recognizing your facial movements and emotions.

This FACS machine may have some down sides to it because this could be a invadement of personal space, say if some doesn't want to talk and use this machine to do so then you used the machine without that persons permission so this machine as long as it used for people that really need the help i don't think this machine will last much. This text from the passage ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, "" Dr. Huang. "" So computars need to understand that,too."" Another upside to this FACS machine is that it could become a human inscrutor "" A classroom computar could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effecttive human instructor.""

The FACS machine could be a huge help with students that struggle emotionaly with anything, so for final conclsuion the FACS machine can a huge help to students but also be a invasion of personal space, because some students don't know that their computars have this program and reads their emotions without them knowing ahead of time. This FACS machine should be installed if the students want it to be installed.",0
"Along with other students, Summer has always been one of my favorite seasons; the reason for this is because there's no school. Since there's no school for students during summer, we tend to forget everything that was taught to us throughout the school year. Schools believe students should not forget all of the valuable things we learned throughout the school year when we go into summer break, for this reason many schools require students to complete a summer project. The issue with having a summer project is many people can't decide if the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. I believe the project should be teacher-designed because they know what knowledge the project should have for the students to learn, and they would know what projects would interest the students.

Some may argue and claim: the students would know better than the teachers on what interest them. Though, as everyone may probably know, some students don't always have the same interest as each other; for example, the athletic kids may not be into what the tech kids are into. So this task to pick a project for everyone may be be difficult for the students to figure out. On the other hand, teachers may have it easier figuring out what interest all or almost all of the students. Teachers could conduct surveys and have students fill out their interest, and the teachers can design the project based on the answers provided by the survey. Although, this method may not be entirely great for each individual student, it would be great for the majority of them.

Teachers would also know what specific knowledge they would include in the projects for their students. For example, they would know what is important for the student to learn from the project and what to remember from their previous school year, so they can take that information onto the next school year. While if the summer project was designed by students; they wouldn't know what's is important for them to learn or what previous knowledge to include. The knowledge that this project would contain is crucial to the learning and understanding of the students. This is something that possibly only teachers would be able to prepare correctly: for students this would be too much responsibility.

Though, seeing the side of the students wanting to design the project is very understandable. I understand that they feel as if they know themselves and their peers better than the teachers, so they would know what type of project would attract the other students. Students could also ask their teacher from the previous and the following year: what is beneficial and important for them to learn from the project. Although, it's better if the teachers were to design the project, that doesn't mean the students don't have the ability to do it.

Therefore, students can design the summer project if given the chance, but given the circumstances, it's better if the teachers would have the responsibility of designing it. Teachers just know what knowledge the project should contain for the students to learn, and they would know what type of project would interest the students. I've thoroughly explained why teachers would be the better candidate for this job, rather than the students.

Overall, what's important here is not who designs the project, but instead the project itself. This project determines what is valuable for the students to know before going into the following school year.",0
"Dear Principle,

By not letting students without a B average not play sports will cause many problems. Some kids just are not that smart, but are very good at a sport. It will decrease the amount of kids playing in sports as well. I could understand if they were about failing, not letting them play, but a B average is outrageous.

Some kids are very athletic in our community. They are not very smart but they meet the requirements to play. If you changed this , there would not be as many kids playing in sports.

We may not even have a sports team because we don't have kids playing. this may not just be in sports either.

It may also affect kids in band and other extra curricular activities. Kids will be devastated at this fact. The thing they love is gone because of their grade. Although it will help the kids strive to do better in school, but it may cause them to not care anymore and give up.

We already have problems with the C average, if you change it to a B, it will cause even more problems.",0
"I do not beleive that the author justifies their statement of ""Venus has value"" in paragraph 8. The author does not explain the pros of exploring Venus as well as they explain the cons of why we should explore Venus. Why do I think this? Well the autor describes the deadly, hot and thick atmosphere of Venus, stating that the reason exploring Venus is worth the risk is because ""Venus still has some features that are analigous to those on Earth."" Well, does that justify spending millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on a rover or a spacecraft to explore it? I don't beleive so.

It's quite simple to explain why Venus does not need to be explored or closly examined from high up in it's atmosphere. The pros do outweigh the cons in this aticle, here is a quote from the author: ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That temperature is obviously deadly to humans, and that is a major risk when it comes to spending millions on making a rover that will only last up to a couple hours just to get a glimps on the planet. Or maybe just to get a couple pictures. The author does not go on to say how exploring Venus with genuinley benifit the human race. The author simply explains how scientists are curious about the planet and what is on it, I do not beleive that satisfying our curiosity will help anyone. This is a quote from paragraph 8 of the article that states: ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

Now, to add on to the last quote I stated from the article, the author does not state what the human race would do with that ""insight"" that we would gain about Venus, they just state that we would have insight. well then I would ask the author, what is the point in the insight if we wouldn't be able to do anything with the insight that we have gained from the exploration? All that we would gain from spending millions on sending a spacecraft to Venus would be meaningless insight and the feeding of our curiosity. When there are many bigger issues to be solved here on Earth. For example, the crisis that is curently happening in Venesuala, their government is shut down and millions are starving, some familys have resorted in digging through the trash for food and we could help them, but instead we want to spend money on gaining ""insight"" about Venus? Which the article states that Venus is too dangerous to go to anyway. It angers me that half of New York could be underwater in the next thirty years from global warming but we are worried about getting a small peek into the world of Venus.

I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity. But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first. In conclusion, no, I do not beleive that the author of this article did a good job at explaining why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it. Because in the end it's not just the dangers of going to Venus that keeps me from beleiving that we should. It's the problems that we are facing here on Earth that are far more important.",0
"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there are examples proving that this is just a landform. In the beginning of the article is starts out with the things that could have been true such as an alien artifact. Throughout the years technology gradually improved, therefore we could see more. Some still don't believe that it could just be a landform, but I am going to try to give you multiple examples so you can see what we saw.

The first part of the article is information about what we found. It mentions how everyone made a big commotion about the Face. Who wouldn't though? We don't see this often, but it is in fact a butte or mesa. Back in 1976 we didn't get the best picture. So we got closer tried to get the best shot possible. After we got closer, also in 1976, we ended up with a success and get a clear photo. Yes, it did look like a face, also depending on which angle you look at it though. Some say it looked like it resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. It took a lot of research to realize what it was, we had an idea but we weren't so sure in the beginning.

We have people believing that NASA is lying. I can assure you we are not lying. With our budget, we wish there was an ancient civilization. This would be a breakthrough! So for everyone skeptic, and the people thinking we are lying it isn't true. We put so much money and time into researching this. It isn't an easy proccess. It's actually really hard, you have things you have to find out. We also didn't want to give out false information. We had to let people know the truth and that is why we didn't just tell everyone there was a face (landform) on Mars right away.

Eventually it led to the media. The Face was all anyone was talking about. It was everywhere. In the article it talks about how it became a ""pop icon."" It talks about how this ended up starring in a Hollywood film. It appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. It was all people would talk about in the grocery lines as well, or as the article calls it, ""haunted grocery store checkout lines."" This went on for 25 years. This was a very big conspiracy, well that's what some wanted to believe. Since it was everywhere and there were so many rumors about it, this got the people who were big conspiracy theorists all wound up. No matter what information we presented them with, they just didn't want to believe, they were feeding into their own opinions and basing everything off of the untrue rumors. There are many people who still don't believe us to this day.

We are almost 100% sure this is a landform. We have looked very, very closely at these pictures, and it has changed overtime. If you look in the article, at the very beginnning they have three pictures with different years, the first was taking in 1976. The second was in 1998 and the third was in 2001. If you look closely they aren't the same, it's a landform, it changed. We have also looked at things on earth to try to compare. We have landforms in the midwest that look like this as well. Sure some don't look exactly the same as ""the Face"" but that's because they are landforms. Landforms are different. Things erode and change overtime. In the article it says that Garvin had looked at some things as well and he said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" and ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is how he sees it, Which is also fact, there is a Plain in Idaho that he thinks is similar. The lava dome may be something that could have occurred with the mesa on Mars too.

In conclusion, I am writing this and including many reasons why the Face was not created by aliens because I am giving the truth. I have given more than enough reasons and so many different facts. I hope you believe me along with NASA. It's just a landform. It changes overtime, it just happened to look like a face. We get that it looked like a face, but when you think about it, it also depends on how you look at it. It was weird to a lot of people. We are sorry for any false information that was brought up. Just know that false information wasn't from us. These are the facts, I hope I have convinced you. ",0
"Dear Principal,

I think that u should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods. It would make it better for students than be texting or calling in class. Students would pay more attention in class. Then being on there cell phone. But if the teacher see them using there phone they should take it away. They would get there phone back at the end of the day. If they get there phone taking away again in class. They would keep the phone in the office and make there parents come and pick there phone up after school. But when it come to lunch they can use there phone as much as they want. They can call there mom or family if they really need something important. When lunch is over they would turn there phone off. Walk to class and be learning.

That why you should let use the phone during lunch period and free time.      ",0
"Relaxing and warm, the summer approaches after a year of trecherous hard work and learning. But that needed break is interupted by a project that is due at the end of the summer. Over the summer projects should be student designed to allow creativity, inclusivity and give students opportunity to learn about a topic they are passionate about.

During the school year all projects have rubrics, exact instructions and little time to add personal creative touches, but with elongated time and less strict boundries students will be able to tap into their inner creativity and manifest a project that is new and interesting for anyone that views it. Students will be more proud of their project if they have extra time and freedom to make it personal by adding creativity. Often the classroom limits creatvity, so when they are outside of the classroom students should have the room to be as creative as possible. Esspecially because when students are out of school and in the real world creativity is going to be encouraged, so why not start allowing students to utilize their creative mind in a safe environment.

Over the summer students are at home and do not have the resources avaliable that are typically exposed to in a school. Without these resources students might not be able to create a project that is teacher designed. A student designed project, however, would allow students to use their surronding to create a project unique to them. This will allow them feel more connected to the project and encourage them to create somthing excellent. Everyone has a range of strengths and weaknesses and by allowing students to design their own project they will feel more included and are then able to tailor the project to their strengths. If the project is somthing that the student is good at then they will be able to create a better finishing product. In my AP Biology class we do lots of projects, but I'm always less passionate and frusterated by the projects that envolve drawing because it is one of my weaknesses. If the projects were student designed I would be able to create a project that I was really interested in making.

It may seem like a student designed project could be less neat and careless but if the student is passionate about their topic then they will be interested in designing. It will also be important to them, so they will work hard to make it the best they can. My favorite class is psychology and whenever I have a project in that class I want to spend extra time on it and make sure it is good because the topic is important to me. A student designed project is also benefical because students are only outside of school for the summer and on short breaks, so why not utlize this new freedom of being out of school to allow students to design their own project they are passionate about.

A student designed project that allows them to explore passions could inspire a students future career and allow them to learn about something that could further their education in a useful way. If they are passionate about the topic the project will seem less like a burden and more like an opportuntity to make learning fun. If the project is student designed and they are really passionate about it they may decide to continue the project even after it is done. This could end up benefitting the community by supplying a learning tool or by helping a group of people in need.

Allowing over the summer projects to be student designed will allow students to be creative, inclusive to all student environments and strengths and provide an opportuity for students to explore on of their passions in depth. All of these things are benefical to the student and should be encouraged, so that students can grow and learn outside of school as well as during the school year.     ",0
"How would you feel if someone knew how you were feeling all the time? Well now they can. Scientis have created a new software that can detect human emotion to see just how exactly you're feeling. Is it useful? Or is it invasive? I think that it is useful, and here's why.

One way that facial recognition can be helpful, is that it can be used in classrooms to better the learning enviornment. According to paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomig confused or bored."" This can be useful for many teachers who have studnets that are confused but don't want to speak up. This can be very helpful for schools and change the way we learn for the better.

Another reason facial recognition can be useful, is in relationships and partnerships . Many people say that they can't tell how their friend or partner is feeling, but with this new software you just might be able too. In the passage it states that ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on his/her face. Of course, most of us would have toruble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" We might have had trouble detecting those emotions in the past, but not anymore. With this software you can always tell if your friend or partner is angry, sad, worried, or in trouble.

Lastly, one of the most important reason to why we need this computer software is for medicine. According to the passage, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games and video surgery."" If doctors had this kind of technology to use for video surgery, it could change how we precieve medicine. This can make videos more realistic for new surgeons that are trying to learn how to operate. It could save someone's life.

With all of the infromation we have learned from the passage, I think that it is safe to say that this new facial recognition facial software is going to help us in the long run to better the way we learn and change the way we think.        ",0
"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done.

students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking.

students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases.

students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time.

Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise.         ",0
"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality.",0
"The article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the author trying to get me to think that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. What that line is saying is even though Venus is a dangerous place it shouldn't stop you in wanting to go and explore it, to find out more about our solar system. Me as a girl, I don't know if I would want to go travel Venus in knowing that it is very dangerous and has very big risk factors. In this article though the author made me look at it with a bigger perspective. He put some points in that I really liked that got me over the perspective of Venus is a dangerous place. Here are some of the points, if we took the challenege to go visit Venus we would get to see what the Earth-like planet looks like, the understnading of what Venus has on its planet and challenges that we have on Earth should not be limited by dangers, but it should make our imagination and innovation meet bigger standards.

The author said that the closest planet to earth is Venus. Earth and Venus are known as twins. The question is why would anyone want to go visit Venus if it is so dangerous. It's because Venus is the Earth-like planet in our solar system. It is the closest planet that you can study and it is like Earth. People want to discover more about it to see what more the two planets have in common. They know that long time ago Venus had earth like features and was once able to support various forms of life. Now they know that it still has some features earth has. Like a rocky surface, with craters, mountains, and valleys. People want to be able to study Venus so we can see why they can't support forms of life and how it came to be that way.

The second point that caught my attention as I was reading this article, is that how are you going to understand Venus without going their and putting some sort of camera or a human there to get some pieces of Venus. We want to understand Venus so we can start understanding other planets. We start with Venus because it is the closest to Earth and it is similar to earth so we can compare and see what other planets might have in common and what they are like. We want to understand why 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus. We also are trying to figure out why their temperatures andd conditions are extremely worse than any human being on Earth has encoutered. This topic made me realize that starting to understnad Venus can help us start understanding other planets and not just others but our own planet too.

The third point that really caught my eye and has made me think is at the end of the article the author says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This is a very good point to end the article with because he is trying to tell us that don't let things that you fear get in the way of you imagination. Don't let your fears make you from doing something that might change your life in a good way. The author adds this at the end because he wants us to see that he isn't letting the fears of how dangerous Venus is from stopping him from going there and seeing what it is like in the future. It might not even be him, it could be him talking to others saying Venus is okay to go visit because it will open you imagination and innovation.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author makes it very obvious that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He put in multiple points and backed them up with information. The author was very clear in stating why he thinks it is important to keep trying to find a way to visit Venus despite the difficulties. The three points that caught my eye were if we took the chance to go see Venus we would see the Earth-like planet in our solar system, the understanding of what Venus has on its planet, and the challenges that we have on earth should not be limited by dangers, but it should make our imagination and innovation meet biggers standards. I know for sure that if I had the opprotunity to find out more information that could help us in this world but it was dangerous I would find a way to still do it or something I can do to help make it safer for others to do.

"Distance Learning

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. But this is not the best option for children, here are some reasons why this is not beneficial for them.

Firstly, students who participate in distance learning will be less social than a student who attends a school with other students their age. For example, about a year ago my cousin went to her first job interview, she was nervous and was not used to having to talk to adults who were not her parents. She went to the interview but she did not get the job, I believe she lost this job opportunity because the fact that she was home schooled most of her life and was not around enough adults.

Secondly, distance learning could be less beneficial for a student because they are not around people of the same age. Some parents may say that distance learning is just fine for their child because they are around their siblings who are the same age as them. But that is not true, how a student talks and acts around their siblings may not be the same way they should talk and act around a class mate or someone in public. Public education could help them with that.

Thirdly, distance learning may be hard on students, especially if their parent or guardian is not always there to help them, as like a teacher would be. For example, everyone knows that parents and guardians have jobs just like everyone else, even if you are a stay at home parent, it could be difficult for you to be there to help your child with all the questions and problems they have because even a stay at home parent has things that need to be done around the house.

Students need to get out of the house and be in a learning environment around other students their age. This is why I believe distance learning is not as beneficial for students who go to school everyday. So, what is your opinion on distance learning after reading this paper, and would you make the decision to let your child attend distance learning or would they go to school with other students.          ",0
"The idea of a carfree life has become more appealing around the world. In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these sources they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper.

There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, ""A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe"". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there has been many efforts to promote ""car reduced"" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to.

The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and they are happier. ""When i had a car iwas always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has carfree days where they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.

In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year."" It goes on to explain that ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway."" As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which ""pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be benefical such as with the enviroment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a carfree life would soon be very desirable in this world soon.",0
"Do you think aliens exist? The face on Mars was not created by aliens, but by the natural forming of the planet. These examples will show how the face on Mars came to be.

The face on Mars was just a natural occurence and not a cover up from aliens. The first example is there are other little landforms right by the face. This exampl means that the face was just another landform and that maybe things formed just right to look semi-close to a human face. The second example is that as cameras got better it started looking less and less like a face. This example states that as cameras got better resolutions they actually found out it was just a mesa. The final example is when they were looking at the face there were misty clouds in the way. This example shows that the clouds could have interfered with the picture causing shadows to hover over the face at just the right angle to give the face a more human look. Finally, these examples show how the face was just a natural occuring landform and not a human-like face.

If aliens in fact did make the face then why does it look more like a natural occuring landform then a face. First example is the aliens couldn't have built a mass structure that is about 2 miles long and wide without building anything else. This example shows that the aliens would have had to leave other structures alike there too. The next example is if the aliens did make the structure they would have had to leave footprints or building materials behind. This example shows that the aliens would have had to leave something behind just like we do at construction sites today. The last example is how could have the aliens built such a large structure in such harsh conditons. This example tells that the aliens couldn't have built in under very cold conditons at night and under barely any atomsphere to breath in. Lastly, these examples show that aliens couldn't have built a structure like that on mars even if it was a face.

The structure was just a landform on mars all this time. The first example is if it was a face it would've been hidden by NASA. This means that if it was indeed a face NASA would have hidden it from the public and studied it greatly. The next example is that again, if it was a face NASA would've greatly beneifited from the discovery. This example shows that NASA wouldn't have shown the public if there had been signs of extra terristrial activity. Finally the last example is that aliens did not make this structure because it would've been an actual alien momument. This example tells that if there was evidence of life NASA claimed that they would know. Thus, these examples show of no alien life on mars.

The conspiracy theorsists might think that NASA is hiding something, but they are wrong because it would have beneifited NASA from hiding it. So all this time people have thought it was a face on Mars, they were wrong because pictures have shown of no humane signs on the landform thanks to better technology. So do you still think aliens exist?",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains that studying Venus is a worthy approach despite the dangers. The author impressively supports that the mission to Venus is worth it despite the dangers that might come with it. In the article he provides examples, uses a credible source, and also views the other side. By doing these things it made his point credible and also stronger to the reader.

In the article he provides the example of a floating car above venus to show that a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the conditions but it would provide little sight. He uses to example to illustrate what it would be like to avoid the conditionsby showing this is what the would have to do. He also provides examples to an alternative by saying that there could be electronics to avoid the risks. By providing both of these examples it gives the reader some relateable examples to get an insight into his point.

NASA is a world wide administration that has credibility over the course of its govern. By providing examples of what NASA is doing to show that it should be done, then if NASA is working on it then it makes his point credible. He quotes NASA'S approches on studying Venus so that it can avoid the risks to show that it is possible to explore Venus without the risks. A NASA solution would be that a person could float above the fray. They also have considered sending electronices so it is possible. He saying that it might be difficult but it is attainable. This supports the claim that he supports his claim impresively because he uses sources.

In most arguments the person views the other side so that they can provide an alternative to what they are saying. He uses cons such as no mission has had a man, 97% of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth, and that it could crash a submarine. But then he says that Venus has benefits to that out way the dangers. The benfits include: it is the brightest point, it is close to Earth compared to other space travels, long ago it could support life, and it will expand the edges of imagination and innovation. He provides benefits to out weigh the cons of exploring Venus. He does a great job of explaining why exploring Venus has value and can provides insight to other counter arguments that might rise from others opionions. This is why he does an impressive job supporting his argument.

In conclusion, the author provided points in the argument to make the opinion more credible and also stronger to the reader. In the article the author provided examples, a wide known credible source, and viewed the other side. He impressively supported his opinon that the mission to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Without his evidence to suppport his opinion the article would have not had such an impact on the reader. This is why he did an impressive job supporting his idea.     ",0
"I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College ""winner takes all"" system. It has been working well for the past couple of presidents. Yes, it might be unfair for thoses who are wanting to be electors and can't because the person they are running for lost but the ones who did win are doing what they believe is right. Just because of one big out break in 2000 doesn't mean the system will fail again. It will gradually progress trough out time and soon it won't ever fail again. You just never know unless you let it continue until it doesn't work any longer and when it does you find a new, better system that will work for decades. In 2000 people might have switched their votes because they thought that person desirved it not the other guy. The system of ""winner takes all"" hasn't failed since 2000. It works so why get rid of it. If it were to fail multiple times then yes get rid of it and find something new but it hasn't.    ",0
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Community service should be a revered thing.

Many people are forced to do it if they are facing probation or are already on it.

I don't believe that is the correct thing to do.

Without these people many community service projects would be neglected, but it is still slightly haunting to think about the fact that humans(Americans especially) do not care enough to take care of the other inhabitants of Earth, and sometimes even the Earth itself!

I don't believe that community service should be a requirement but instead a choice.

I consider the option of the student being able to receive extra credit in school for it a very good idea.

If the students of this school need to participate in community service so be it, but you should give them the choice of saying no while making the choice of saying yes so good that it should be nigh impossible to refuse.

If community service is imposed on students there is a chance they will purposely NOT do it.

The students age heavily depend on this.

People at this age are natural rebels, they don't want to do what'd asked of them, and it doesn't matter if its for their good or not.

If you make it sound like there idea or it's not REALLY required they will probably be more accepting to the fact that they are going to have to do it one way or another.

Either way it goes I think that community service is a great idea with great possibilities and that students SHOULD be involved in it.

Just my thoughts,

"The author do it a very good job, because, its very elaborate

Firts, the thougth of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not requiere electronics at all, and then maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down on Venus's in more thn three decades, numerous factors contribute, to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited inshigt on ground conditions becuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, renderig standard forms of photography and videography ineffective, more importantly researchers are maybe we should think of them as challenges, many researchers are working on innovations that would allow allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus.

my conclusion is this essay is very specific, because we need learn, about The Challenge of Exploring Venus.",0
"The culture of the car has been coming to an end. With many people now choosing to have other forms of transportation. Now in Germany they are making cities where they help banned car usage. In the romantic city of Paris,France they are now starting to banned cars due to the overload of smog. The city of Bogota,colombia is having a special day where they banned cars and see the effect of now having cars for a day. The car usage is now being observed to do damage around the world and due to that now cities all over the world is now banning the car usage. This will help to have a healthier earth and healthier people. The benefits of banning cars is going to help everyone and even our beloved earth.

In Germany the people have made a city where they have given up their cars. The city I believe has a better way to maintain a healthy and cleaner environment than other cities in Germany. The banning of cars has been a great success with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is permitted,the problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car intensive areas in the United States.""The greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars. Now that we are able to stop it lets take that chance to help stop the greenhouse gas and to make cleaner and healthier cities.

The romantic city of paris is having a bit of a problem its that its beautiful city is now being coveres in smog due to the overuse of cars. now that Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to help clear the air they can't help to notice that when there are fewer cars being operated the smog begins to clear up. The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that ""Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found."" The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that ""diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe."" That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog. If the the cars are able to to be banned in paris we will see a drop in the smog and Paris will return to the romantic city that it is.

The city of Bogota,Colombia has been celebrating the day without cars for over three years straight. The car free day help leave the streets of the capital city without any traffic jams. One problem of the road that many countries have in their capital city is that they have to many cars because of the tourist and the huge number of people who live there which causes traffic jams leaving cars in the streets for hours on end. They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that ""uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.""The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog. The replacing of cars for bikes and walking is not so much a bad idea if it will help benefit evryone around you.

In conclusion, the car culture is now coming to its end. That nations all over the world has seen the great benefits from banning cars. The greatest effects that banning cars has is that they are helping to get rid of air pollution,stress,and the grreenhouse gas. These are all benfits for everyone it helps the ither people beside u and the environment. The romantic city of Paris was covered in smog due to cars. In Germany where they have developed a city where there is no car in sight and has everything within a walking or bike distance. The city of Bogota,Colombia making a holiday that has been going on for three years straight to have no cars for a day. The people have been seeing that the effects of having no car is wonderful and that we should all do it to better ourselves and to better out enivornment.",0
"Driverless cars have many good thing going for them, but there need to be a line drawn when it come to the safety of our family and friends. Google's effort's to make a driverless car is very interesting, but we need more time to explore the field before it is available to the public. The article states that their are waiting on the law, manufacturing, and the technology/safety for everyone to create a driverless car. We must wait for all of these thing to be finalized before it is in the hands of the public.

The article states that it is ""Waiting on the Law"" to make sure there is liabilty in the case there is an accident with this robot-like car. This is going to raise all kinds of problem involving the manufacturer and the driver. The best way to control these types of problems from occuring is to just stopping the idea of driverless cars. Although, we cannot stop the idea of driverless car we can control who gets to use them. I think the the traffic law is just the beginning of new laws involving driverless car. The only thing that is needed is time and time is what they should be getting.

The manufacturating process in driverless car is very new. This comes from the beginning of the article when ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under conditions since 2009."" Well it is 2016 and there are still laws (specific conditions) that needed to be in place and the manufacturating is can still be updated before it is release to the public. Also there are not yet completely driverless car. The company incharge of driverless car should go the completely mile instead of stop half way. The manufactoring still needs to make the car safe for people to driver in. The new sensors for the car were able to become more advance in a decade. The sensors could be more advance if we wait and the laws for the car will be ready by then.

The most part of not have driverless car and waiting is to increase our safety. We need more time for the technology to beccome advance. Our safety is more important and robot car can be flawed. There should not be any problems with the car when it is released to the public. A robot-like car needs more time to be reviewed by the government and other assoications. Safety for our family and friends is more important.

The idea of driverless car is interesting, but there are still some unanswerable questions that needed to be answered before there are in the publics hands. The time for the driverless car is in the future, but the only stopping them from being released is the laws.    ",0
"I had to make a very important decision recently: I had to decide which language I was going to take. My options were Spanish and Latin, and I was leaning towards Spanish. However, I decided to get my parents' opinions to make sure I was making the best choice. Both of my parents thought I should take Latin. My mom said that taking Spanish in high school hadn't really helped her, and my dad said the same. I also got advice from my teachers, and they told me which language they thought would be best. Eventually, I changed my mind and chose to take Latin, a class I have greatly enjoyed. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make an informed choice, they can help you make a choice you benefit from, and they can help you make a choice that you don't regret later.

When you get advice from multiple people, you get lots of information that can aid you in making the best decision possible. When I was seeking opinions about my language choice, I wanted to know how each language could benefit you and if the people that took the language still used it today. I needed to choose the language that could help me the most, now and in the future. Getting multiple opinions helped me make an informed choice.

Making a decision that benefits you later is another good example of how seeking advice from multiple sources can help you. For instance, I have already noticed that Latin has helped me. I have been using the things it has taught me and applying them in daily life. I can make connections between Latin and English words and if there is an English word I don't know, I can use the skills I have developed in Latin to figure it out. The language I chose has helped me so much already, and I am only in my first year! If I hadn't gotten multiple opinions, I would have chosen Spanish and would not be learning all the wonderful things I am now.

Also, seeking multiple opinions can keep you from making a choice you would later regret. When I was getting advice from my dad, he told me that he wishes he had taken Latin. He is a doctor, and a lot of medical terms have Latin roots. If he had taken Latin, he would be able to figure out what some of those terms mean without looking them up. He regrets the choice he made about his language, and if he had gotten more advice, he might have made a different choice that he was happier with. I, on the other hand, do not regret my decision at all. It might be a little early to know this, but I have seen how it has benefited me, and I think I made the best choice. I was able to do this because of the great advice I got.

I am thriving in Latin, and it is all because I took the advice of many different people. I asked them what they thought, and I collected that information until I knew what the best choice was. I made my decision and am very happy with it. Seeking multiple opinions helped me greatly and I don't regret my choice at all.",0
"Imagine your principal creating an extra curricular activity assignment that you have to choose whether to be in a sport, yearbook comitee, or student council. I for one would be in love with this idea.

Extra curricular activities are fun, stress coping, and can improve life skills.

If I were to choose an activity it would definitely be a sport.

Sports to me are just my life, they take time away from school and relieve so much stress.

I completely agree with the principals assignment and I would recommend to a lot of people that participating in an extra curricular activity would be a good thing.

Extra curricular activity relieve a lot of stress from school and give an extra hobby to participate in. Taking stress away from school is a very important to a students mind.

With to much stress students don't preform as well as they should because their mind is clouded by all the work they have to get done that they have for later.

Students with lots of stress their grades tend to drop because they cannot function, but with extra curricular activities they can get help and complete their missing work with the help of others. An extra curricular activity I would recommend to students with this problem is to stay after school and get help from a teacher.

Therefore after this session with your teacher you have completed your work and now some stress is gone.

With extra curricular activities students have the option of help and they can succeed by using this method.

Extra curricular activities can also be really fun.

Sports is a great extra curricular activity that is fun. With sports you can play with your friends and have fun. I play on a sports team and it is really fun because a lot of my friends are on the team causing sports to be more enjoyable to me, but what if you don't like sports. There are many extracurricular activities that are also fun. What I recommend is that you find something your good at and join or make a extra curricular activity about it. Extra curricular activities can be really fun or boring but if you get something out of it, than it has some type of meaning.

Life skills are an important need in life and extracurricular activities can help with that. Some extra curricular activities that you can make or find that can help with life skills is Baking,Sewing, and speaking a different language there are places near you that can help you with life skills.

An example of this is my mom participates in a cooking class down the street from my house and my dad participates in a foreign language class so when he travels for work he'll know how to speak in a foreign language and understand what people are saying there.

Extra curricular activities are there to help you with life skills too.

I completely agree with the principals assignment and I would recommend to a lot of people that participating in an extra curricular activity would be a good thing. Extra curricular activities are fun, stress coping, and can improve life skills. Extra curricular activities can make it easier to suite your personal needs and help you get work done.

Extra curricular activities can also be fun and interactive with other people. But the main thing to remember is that extracurricular activities are supposed to help with your needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ",0
"Did the author support their idea well in this article? I do believe he did. I saw many reasons as to why we should at least try to go to venus. He gave many reasons as to how Venus is very simillar to Earth and could be inhabited one day. He also gave many reasons as to how it could be dangerous, and why people haven't really been able to do so yet. They mention things about what Venus has done to other space crafts in the past, and what it can do to others now even.

The author gives many reasons as to why Venus is reffered to as Earths ""twin."" He says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" In this he tells us that Venus is like Earth in the ways of how dense it is and how large it is. He also says that it is occasionally close to us, so that shows us that it could be just like Earth, but with some differences. The author also says in paragraph 4, ""it may have once been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported many forms of like, just like Earth."" With this he is telling us that there could be fossils, or we could one day maybe inhabit Venus if needed, with adaptations of course.

The author also says that the journey would be dangerous. He mentions in paragraph 2 ""each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no space craft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."" In this he is telling us just how dangerous it is, because tipically you would think of a machine being tougher than the human body, but as you think about it you can see just as fast as that machine was destroyed. If that machine was destoryed so quickly imagine how quickly the human body would be. He also says ""not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This also lets us know how hard it would be to get there and how fast, if the right materials aren't used, something can be destroyed during the trip.

The author then gives us NASA's plan as to how somebody would be able to access Venus in paragraph 5. He tells us that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would be to allow scientists to float above the fray."" He gives us this idea so that we can think about it being a safer route and that maybe with this method somebody could be able to make it. With his evidence in the previous paragraphs we can conclude it would be very dangerous to land on Venus, but not to be above it. He also gives us a scenario of what it would be like for the scientists floating above. He tells us, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up out of their way.. temperatures would still be toasy at arounf 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth... radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" By telling us this he is saying that it wouldn't be the most comfortable thing, but it would be liveable. He is showing us that it would be possible, and if they really wanted to, they could explore Venus.

In paragraph 8 he mentions that the ""scientist floating above would only give limited insignt,"" with this we can see that there still wouldn't be everythig solved, but we would still be closer than we've ever gotten. He also says in paragraph 8, ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Meaning that the scientists wouldn't be able to photograph anything on Venus to look at later. The scientists would only be able to look at things closet than anybody ever has, but not be able to document any of it. With this we can also see that we wouldn't be able to see what Venus looked like from Earth, making it hard to report back on findings and research.

All in all I beleive the author did support his idea well. He gave the pros and cons and was able to explain everything out. I myself don't know it it would be worth all the money in supplies, but I do think with NASA's idea we can get closer than we've ever gotten before. The conditions would be liveable, but maybe a little uncomfortable, and we could get some good information on Venus. If Venus is as closely related to Earth as the author makes it out to be, then maybe it could be worth a shot, but I am still debating on it. It's nothing the author did, because he did explain and support everything very well, but I've always had very strong opinions on everything.    ",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about Earth's sister planet and the chaotic environment it hosts. They also mention that for years, scientists have been trying to discover ways that this planet may be hospitable or of good use to humans. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the risks and dangers because evidence shows that it has features much like Earth, and could sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary visit.

Geographical features show that at one time, Venus was likely covered with oceans and could have supported life. The author states, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (4). This shows that while conditions on Venus may be particularly brutal, there is a high chance it was once a habitable land like Earth.

Though there are certainly high risks that come with traveling to such a dangerous planet, there are ways for humans to survive them. The author mentions that, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. ... the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"" (5). With humans' current technological advances, it is made possible to avoid the worst of the cruel conditions on Venus, like sweltering heat and impossible atmospheric pressure.

In conclusion, there is a lot to look at for both sides of this topic. The author does a good job with addressing the issues that come with sending space crafts and people to Venus, while also talking through the ways some complications might be avoided. ",0
"Once upon a time, there was a girl. A pretty girl, but she wasn't a normal fairytale princess. She had a long day ahead of her and was already tired. Her days were long, her weeks were longer, and everyday she was waiting for sleep. Her schedule was busy and life was getting to hard to juggle. She talked to her friend about her struggles, but her friend didn't give her the best advice. He said, ""you will be fine, it can't be that much."" So she went on and did her best. Slowly, her grades were not as good as they used to be and she wasn't doing her best. She then talked to her mom about the issue. Her mom decided to help her with time management. Now, she happily gets everything done on time and is having fun doing it. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because people get different views, people get the best outcome, and people get the most truth.

Firstly, getting opinions from others is a part of life. Talking to people of different cultures and backgrounds gives you a unique perspective. Others don't always agree and those people are probably the people that you want advice from. This is because they are more likely to tell you how something is. Some people are more knowledgable on certain things than others. For example, I could go on and on about track and field, but couldn't tell anyone a single thing about football. While others, watch and play football regliously. The perspective of others, helps us to form our own perspective.

Secondly, in a scientific expirement, people are suposed to repeat the expirement at least three times to get the most accurate results. The same is with life: the more times someone asks, for advice, the better the outcome will be. In a 2016 study, 70% of people who reached out to three or more people about their issues saw in increase in joy and fufillment. This shows that asking people for advice only helps. Good choices stem from other people. That is why it is important to be a good role model. The final outcome that everyone hopes for is that the best choice is made for that person and the ones around them.

Thirdly, when asking more than one person, people get the most truth. It is logical that if anyone asks for advice from multiple people someone will be honest with them. We all have someone in our lives that we go to when we just want a honest and raw response. For example, I was at my first track meet. After the meet, I talked to my parents about how I did. My mom and dad told me that I did great, but my dad also told me what I can work on to be better next time. People are most truthful when they know someone can handle it. Therefore, don't take constructive feedback as a bad thing.

In conclution, different views are important to look for because everyone is in a different season of their life. Our reputation depends greatly on our actions and choices. In this same way, the kinds of people others go to for advice is important. Older and wiser people are going to give the best advice because they have probably been through something simular in their lives. It is honesty that helps keep people accountable. Overall, seeking multiple opinions helps everyone make better choices.  ",0
"Dear principal,

I have been informed about certain schools requiring their student body to perform various community service activities. Me being part of this schools large student body, is not proud of such a huge decision. If you think about it volunteering is a great help to communities and some of the people volunteering themselves. Most students though really need to perform community service. For example, students that are part of SCHOOL_NAME have to get volunteer hours. Some people just don't have time to complete such tasks. In fact 65% of American students are given so much homework and projects they only have 12% of time left in the day to do different activities. It is a large request to enforce such an important rule so I would not require students to do community service, unless told to do so. I would let my pupils of this school be given many opportunities to perform community service though. Hopefully you will not enforce this rule at our school. Make the right decision and know what this impact might have on the student body.

Sincerely, an informed student",0
"Have you ever wanted to explore or learn more about other planets? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is a near by planet, and it has much intel that we need to understand. Is the data, and research we could get from this mysterious planet worth the risk? The research we can get from Venus is well worth the risk it may take to retrieve the data needed.

We have never been to this planet before in person, but we have had unmanned ships come to Venus but with the outstanding temperatures of 800 or more degrees Fehrenhiet, and the thick atmosphere they only last on the planet a near only few hours. With the planet atmosphere 97% carbon dioxide, and Highly acidic and corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere there is a big challenge even landing a ship for a day.

You may ask why would we even keep atempting to go there when there when we can't even have a ship there for even a day. We could get a lot of things from there that may help understand more about the planet and space travel. Long ago scientist believe that is once just like earth. Holding bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, and more with trees and other life forms. The planet this holds some features of a planet that was once habbitablem, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment which includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

Even if we did need this, and people all around the world wanted to go there you may be thinking just how could we since the planet seems to destroy everything we send there. With better technology, and using computer sytems from the 1800s, and early 1900s we may be able to with updated sytems. These computers consist of a systems that use gears to calculate everything, meaning they aren't as fragile as other newer faster computers. Scientist believe they may be able to use these and more reinforced materials to make the ship stronger, they tested them in a chamber that had conditions like Venus and so far the materials have laster as long as three weeks.

At this point is it worth not taking the risk to get to Venus? We have improved and even may get there very safely. The risk don't present as much as rish but challenges. With all the benefits of traveling there, they overway the risk. Venus is worthy of pursuit to get anwsers and understandings we need to know such as did Venus once have life.",0
"Since the car was first created there has been many innovations to different types of cars. However, studies have shown that in the last few years the percentage of people getting a license has dropped. There are many advantages in limiting car usage not only in the city but also in the suburbs.

The first of these advantages has to due with our never ending problem with our environment. For example, as stated in source number 2 the city of Paris had been very polluted. To solve this problem the ruling party in France enforced a driving ban. After five days of this driving ban being in effect the smog in Paris had gone down by 60%. because of this ban the city of Paris is a cleaner place to live now and another result of this ban is that people truly can see how much pollution these cars create.

Another advantage of limiting car use is that once these cars are gone people are much more sociable. In source 1, the government of Germany has created a suburban community where there is no cars. Car ownership is allowed however there are only two places to park and it is very expensive. Because of this 70% of families in this community do not own cars. To get around in this community you are able to walk, ride a bike, skate, etc. As a result, you do not hear cars on the streets but you do hear bike swishing and kids playing with eachother. Many studies have also shown that a day without a car is a very effective stress reliever, as stated in Source 3.

Now a world without cars is very hard to imagine because of all the different places that everybody has to get there however, there are many alternatives to using cars on a daily basis. These alternatives include public transportation, bikes, skates, walking, and also car pooling. If there is a reduction of car usage the environment will receive a very large benefit.

As the articles provided has shown, there are many advantages to the limiting of car usage and it will not only benefit us as humans but also our environment.",0
"Dear Principal,

I think it should be required that all students should perform community service because it is a very good thing that us as children should help others and the planet. If those that do attend are doing a good job at helping the planet and others. I think those who do help should clean up any mess thrown on the floor, on the road or just left somewhere. We can stop wasting water by turning off just a little bit of water dripping from the sink or shower head or even the water hose outside. We can do so much that can keep us active, healthy, and we would be doing a very good deed for the planet. Helping some younger children learn by tutoring them on a subject or teaching them how to help the community in doing community service. So i think that even just walking some dogs or helping an elderly cross streets is even just helping for the community. So i think that all students here and there should do community service it can be a good thing that some students will experience. It can even change some kids lives on how they help the community.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME",0
"Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potentially become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go ""down 60 percent... after fivedays of intensifying smog."" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. additionally, limiting car usage can push more people into exercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians ""hiked, biked, skated..."" during their carfree days source 3. Also, many ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city"" source 3. With an increase of exercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

furthermore, lowering car usage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a carowner may ""buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home source 1."" Normally, a decent size house is approximately 100,000 to 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said ""I'm much happier this way source 1,"" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stressfree lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.",0
"I honestly think that Policy 1 is a more reasonable choice than Policy 2. Policy 1 gives students the freedom to have their phones on school grounds and use them, but not the distraction of using them in class. In my opinion, Policy 1 is a better choice. Not being able to bring phones to school would mean students may not be able to contact Parents, Guardians, or other family members that they need to contact.

A student may need a way to get home but without having his/her phone they would have no way to contact someone to pick them up. Also, Policy 1 gives students socializing time without being late to class. Teachers wouldn't have to take up phones and distract the rest of the class because a student was using their phone. Students would have the opportunity to talk to people that they can't meet up with in the hallways, or after school.

I think teachers and students would benefit from Policy 1. If you chose Policy 2 i honestly think that students would bring them anyway and use them during class, causing them to not pay attention and make bad grades. If you enforced Policy 1 most students wouldn't be using them in class, for they can use them in free time and during lunch. Having the opportunity to use them in free time would make students more motivated to finish their work, and get things done.

There's a chance that students would fail because of them using their phones in class, and not paying attention to what's being taught. I honestly would enjoy being able to use my phone during lunch and free periods in the day. Others would enjoy it also. Most students would be against Policy 2.",0

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones are a part of everyone's life in the twenty first century. Society uses them for everything from keeping up with social media, remaining in contact with people, personal entertainment and so much more. With so many people in possession of a cell phone, it is no surprise that they use them at inappropriate times. One of those times is while driving, the use of a cell phone while driving is not only dangerous but irresponsible. I think drivers should not use their phone while behind the wheel.

Driving while on a cell phone is almost as bad as driving while under the influence. In the article LiveScience, it says; ""Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash,"" said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the NSC. ""Driving drunk is also dangerous and against the law. When our friends have been drinking, we take the car keys away. It's time to take the cell phone away"". This shows that not only is driving while on the phone four times more dangerous than driving without a cell phone but it is also as dangerous as drunk driving. Cell phone use while driving is also common amongst teen drivers. According to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States"". This statistic shows that multitasking behind the wheel is dangerous and becoming a life-long risk. Knowing these statistics drivers should take more caution and families should take control of this risk.

People might argue that they should have their own choice whether to use a cell phone while driving. In the article , Stop Texting and Driving ""Since each driver recognizes the potential dangers they could involve themselves with if they choose to text and drive, a law should not dictate a ban on texting and driving behind the wheel."" This statement from the article shows that people think they should have their own choice if they want to text and drive and it shouldn't be a law. Humans will always make mistakes while driving. In the the article FEE it says; Earlier government studies have repeatedly found other distractions to pose a far more serious problem than phone-related distraction. According to 2010 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, cell phone distraction has barely budged as a fatal crash factor, ranked behind drivers being ""lost in thought."" This has not led to calls for nationwide prohibitions on daydreaming while driving"". In the year of 2010, cell phone use while driving wasn't the most dangerous thing to do while driving.

In the article THE ZEBRA, texting while driving statistics from 2012-2018 say that ""14% of distracted driving deaths were attributed specifically to cell phone use, as opposed to other forms of distracted driving.""

"Dear Senator , I have read a lot about electoral college voting. It seems like a legit way of finding the right president to be in charge of our country.

But it also says that it's a compromise between the votes in Congress , and the votes of the popularity from the people. Is it a 50/50 compromise or does Congress have a stronger voting advantage over the people?

I think that if your going to make Congress's choices , able to rule over the peoples , then there shouldn't be two sides of the voting. Its not fair to us. It should be an equal advantage. There should be a way for that to happen if there already isn't one. Congress and society need to have an equal chance at electing the best man for the job.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes , the winner. The cause of this is probably because Congress think theyare more wise and think this throught more then the people do. But I think differently. The citizens of the US , can be just as smart as Congress. Maybe even smarter or wiser.

I honestly think that you should leave a majority of it to the people because we can the research before we vote so we know which one would make the best choices for our country. If you gave us a chance to show you what we can do and that we can be smart about things , then maybe you would recommend the people being in charge of more things.    ",0
"Having multiple opinions can be beneficial when making a choice. Hearing different perspectives can make it easier to consider all of the pros and cons. Listening to others can provide insight into both why a choice should be made and why it should be avoided. It can also prompt creative solutions for the issue at hand. Additionally, advice from close friends or family can be a huge help in making decisions. They are likely to be more informed about the situation and can provide a unique perspective. For these reasons, getting input from multiple sources can be a great way to make a better decision.",1

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. While the Electoral College may have its critics, I firmly believe that this system has many advantages that outweigh the arguments for switching to a direct popular vote.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's report, the winner of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear and decisive victory, avoiding any potential disputes that may arise from a close popular vote. The possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely, and the Electoral College system ensures that the candidate with the broadest support across different regions becomes the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes inclusivity and prevents candidates from relying solely on the support of a single region. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that the system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure a victory. This means that candidates must reach out to voters in different states, ensuring that their concerns and issues are taken into account. It fosters national unity by preventing candidates from solely focusing on the interests of specific regions, making the president truly represent all Americans.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are crucial in determining the outcome of elections. In these toss-up states, candidates and their campaigns engage directly with voters, listen to their concerns, and tailor their platforms accordingly. This increases political participation and attentiveness among voters in these battleground states, as they know their votes can make a significant impact on the final outcome. By using the Electoral College, we empower the most thoughtful and engaged voters to determine the election.

Another key advantage of the Electoral College is that it balances the influence of large and small states. While some argue that this is unfair, it is important to recognize that it compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate in our Constitution. The Electoral College gives larger states with more electoral votes a greater voice in the election process, ensuring that they receive adequate attention from presidential candidates. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on small states and encourages them to address the concerns of all Americans, regardless of population size.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for costly and complicated runoff elections. By design, the Electoral College encourages candidates to seek a majority of electoral votes rather than just a plurality of the popular vote. This guarantees a clear winner and prevents the prolonged uncertainty and additional expenses associated with run-off elections. It streamlines the presidential election process and allows for a seamless transition of power.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy that has served us well for over two centuries. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes inclusivity by requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, encourages campaign efforts in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. While some argue for a switch to a direct popular vote, it is crucial to consider the practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College.

I urge you to support the Electoral College system and resist any attempts to abolish or change it. Let us continue to uphold the principles and compromises set forth by our founding fathers, ensuring a fair and effective presidential election process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about the school menu and how it affects our health and grades. I think it's pretty important, 'cause like, what we eat affects how we feel and how we learn.

So, the pros of changing the menu are that it would make us healthier. If we eat more fruits and veggies, we'll be stronger and more focused in class. And if we don't eat too much junk food, we won't get as many cavities or feel as tired. Plus, my friend Emma's mom is a nutritionist and she says that eggs are really good for you, so maybe we could have more of those.

But, the cons are that it might be expensive to change the menu. Like, buying all new food and stuff. And some people might not like the new food, so they might not eat it. And if we don't eat enough, we might get hangry and that's not good for anyone. Plus, some people have allergies or dietary restrictions, so it's hard to make sure everyone can eat the same thing.

I think my school could learn from other schools that have already changed their menus. Like, my cousin goes to a school that only serves vegetarian food and they're really healthy and smart. And my friend Jack's school has a salad bar and they love it. So, maybe we could do something like that.

In conclusion, I think we should change the menu 'cause it would make us healthier and happier. But, we gotta make sure it's not too expensive or hard to do. Maybe we could have a survey or something to see what everyone thinks. Thanks for reading!",1
"When it comes to making important decisions, neither of the options - asking for guidance from experts or relying solely on your own instincts and ideas - are necessarily better than the other. It all depends on the situation and the individual. For instance, when I was trying to make a decision about what college to attend, I found myself relying heavily on the opinions of experts and other people who had been in a similar situation before. Although I valued my own self-reliance, hearing experienced perspectives gave me valuable insight into what I should take into account when making this decision. This allowed me to make a more informed and confident decision.

At the same time, it's important to note that I still trusted my own instincts and ideas. I weighed the expert advice I received against my own opinion and decided which one was best for me. It's always okay to ask for help even if you value self-reliance - it's a sign of strength. Asking for help can help you make the best decision based on other people’s experience and knowledge, and still allow you to rely on your instincts to make the final decision.",1
" In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. People who start a career can make it happen. Students who took it early can ask their counselor for advice. Many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses, students can get a job after college, and students don't have to worry about making one in the future. However, starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses, it can cause lots of thinking to make one, and it can cause waste of time.

Students will quit their courses. For instance, when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks, they will usually give up. Furthermore, it can cause people to lose interest about their career. Teens who quit their courses, they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keep up. Therefore, it is important to think first before taking that class.

It can cause lots of thinking to make one. For example, it takes time for adults to make their career. In addition, they will mostly think about getting a job first. Adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first. Not only that, adults like to spend time with their friends, but they make their career after they get paid enough to start their life.

It can cause waste of time. In fact, kids will spend time playing video games than making a career. Moreover, they think that career is school related. When making a career, kids will often write ""don't know"" and they will usually get back to their hobby. Thus, it is essential to make a plan first before making a career at a young age.

Making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people over think, it made them go back doing something, and it can cause them negative towards their courses. When ever they took their class about two ore three weeks, they usually will give up. Kids will often write ""don't know"" on their career paper. Making a career will take time for people to make, but don't give up easily if they can't pace up. It is important to understand that starting a career at a young age can have a significant impact on a person's life, and it is essential",1
" In Winston Churchill's famous statement, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts,"" there are several reasons why I disagree. While failure can be a setback, it can also be a valuable learning experience and a catalyst for growth.

Firstly, failure can help individuals identify areas where they need to improve. For example, if someone fails at a job, they may realize that they need more experience or different skills. This realization can be a catalyst for personal and professional development. By embracing failure and learning from it, individuals can take one step closer to success.

Secondly, failure can be especially challenging for young people in school or college. However, it is important to remember that failure is a natural part of the learning process. Instead of giving up, young people should use failure as an opportunity to reflect on their mistakes, learn from them, and continue to work towards their goals.

Lastly, the pursuit of success is important in life for everyone, but it should not be the only focus. While success can bring material rewards, it is not the ultimate goal. Rather, it is the courage to continue in the face of adversity that truly counts. By staying true to one's values and pursuing their passions, individuals can achieve a sense of fulfillment and purpose that transcends material success.

In conclusion, while failure can be a setback, it can also be a valuable learning experience and a catalyst for growth. By embracing failure and using it as an opportunity to learn and grow, individuals can take one step closer to success.",1

"As an 8th-grade student, I have witnessed the benefits of intergenerational collaboration in the classroom. Younger and older students can help each other in various ways, including academics, understanding help, and working together. In this essay, I will discuss how students of different ages can support each other in the classroom and how it can benefit everyone involved.

Firstly, younger students can benefit from the academic knowledge of older students. Older students can provide guidance and support to younger students in various subjects. For example, if a younger student is struggling with a particular concept in math, an older student can explain it to them in a way that is easier to understand. This can lead to a better understanding of the material and improved academic performance.

Secondly, older students can also benefit from the understanding help provided by younger students. Younger students can explain complex concepts in simpler terms, making it easier for older students to understand. This can be particularly helpful for older students who may have forgotten some of the basics or who are learning a new subject.

Finally, working together in groups can be beneficial for both younger and older students. When students of different ages work together, they can bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. This can lead to more creative solutions and a better understanding of the material. Additionally, working in groups can help students develop important social skills, such as communication and collaboration.

In conclusion, younger and older students can help each other in various ways, including academics, understanding help, and working together. This intergenerational collaboration can benefit everyone involved, as it can lead to improved academic performance, a better understanding of the material, and the development of important social skills. As an 8th-grade student, I encourage my peers to embrace intergenerational collaboration in the classroom and to recognize the benefits it can bring.",1
"Graduating high school in three years rather than four has numerous advantages that should be explored and encouraged. For many students, graduating high school early not only reduces the amount of tuition costs required, but also provides them with an opportunity to get a jumpstart on their college education or pursue a job in their desired field of study. By beginning college or a career early, these students have the opportunity to start growing professionally and financially sooner, giving them a competitive advantage.

Furthermore, for students struggling with social or personal issues, graduating early can provide them with an opportunity to get away from what could be a difficult or unfulfilling four year high school experience. Finally, leaving high school early also provides students the opportunity to explore and develop new interests or travel abroad, which can be a very beneficial experience in terms of self-discovery and personal growth.

At the same time, graduating high school in three years can also come with significant challenges. For one thing, graduating early requires hard work and dedication, and high achieving students may have to work hard to maintain good grades and stay on track with their classes. Additionally, since three year graduation is not as common as four year graduation, those looking for scholarships or other forms of financial aid may find it more difficult to find adequate resources. 

Additionally, students may feel unprepared for the world that awaits them upon graduating high school early. Because these students graduate without having experienced all the traditional four year high school activities, they may miss out on a crucial part of a high school experience. 

Despite these challenges, graduating high school in three years should still be encouraged due to the numerous benefits associated with the process. By starting college or a career early, students can get a competitive edge, make social or personal progress, or explore new opportunities. As long as students are prepared to face the challenges ahead, graduating high school early can be an extremely beneficial decision.",1
"Community service is an important aspect of being a responsible citizen. It is the act of volunteering time and resources to help others and make a positive impact on the community. Many people believe that community service is a waste of time, but I believe that it is an essential part of being a good citizen.

One reason why community service is important is that it allows individuals to give back to their community. By volunteering their time and resources, they can help those in need and make a positive difference in the lives of others. This not only helps the community, but it also allows individuals to feel a sense of fulfillment and purpose.

Another reason why community service is important is that it teaches individuals the importance of responsibility. By taking part in community service, individuals learn to take responsibility for their actions and the impact they have on others. This is an important lesson that will serve them well in the future.

Some people believe that community service is a waste of time because they feel that they have more important things to do. However, I believe that community service is an essential part of being a good citizen. It allows individuals to make a positive impact on the world and teaches them the importance of responsibility.

It is also important that people take responsibility for their waste and disposing of it properly. When individuals do not properly dispose of their waste, it can have a negative impact on the environment and the community. By taking responsibility for their waste and properly disposing of it, individuals can help to keep their community clean and healthy.

There are many ways that we as citizens can make our community and world a better place. One way is by volunteering for community service projects. This can involve cleaning up trash in the community, volunteering at a local food bank, or helping out at a homeless shelter. Another way is by reducing waste and properly disposing of it. This can involve recycling, composting, and reducing the use of single-use plastics.

In conclusion, community service is an important aspect of being a responsible citizen. It allows individuals to give back to their community, teaches them the importance of responsibility, and helps to keep the community clean and healthy. As citizens, it is our responsibility to take part in community service and make a positive impact on the world. I urge everyone to take part in community service and make a difference in the lives of others.",1
" The adoption of a 10 P.M weekday curfew for teenagers has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that it is important to have a midnight curfew because it will help teenagers avoid getting into trouble with others or with their families. However, I believe that a 10 P.M curfew is more important because it will allow teenagers to spend more time with their families and also give them more time to complete their homework.

Those who believe that a midnight curfew is important argue that it will interfere with young people's lives. They argue that teenagers have the freedom to do whatever they want, and that a curfew will limit their ability to make their own decisions. However, I believe that a 10 P.M curfew is necessary because it will help teenagers avoid getting into trouble with others or with their families.

Others believe that a 10 P.M curfew is important because it will give teenagers more time to spend with their families. They argue that many teenagers do not spend enough time with their families, and that a curfew will give them the opportunity to bond with their parents or siblings. Additionally, a curfew will give teenagers more time to complete their homework, which is important for their academic success.

In conclusion, I believe that the adoption of a 10 P.M weekday curfew for teenagers is important because it will allow them to spend more time with their families and also give them more time to complete their homework. While some may argue that a midnight curfew is necessary to protect teenagers from getting into trouble, I believe that a 10 P.M curfew is more important because it will help teenagers make better decisions and be more successful in their academic pursuits.",1
"I disagree with the decision made by our principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While I understand the importance of being involved in extracurricular activities, I believe that mandating it for all students is not the best approach.

Firstly, not all students have the same interests or abilities. Some students may not enjoy participating in sports or may not have the necessary skills to join a team. Similarly, some students may not have an interest in working on the yearbook or serving on the student council. By forcing students to participate in an activity they do not enjoy, it may lead to a negative experience and a lack of motivation to continue.

Secondly, some students may have other commitments outside of school that prevent them from participating in extracurricular activities. For example, they may have family obligations, work, or other personal responsibilities that take up their time. Mandating participation in an extracurricular activity may add additional stress and pressure to these students, which could negatively impact their academic performance.

Lastly, mandating participation in extracurricular activities may take away from the time students have to explore their own interests and passions. Students should have the freedom to choose how they want to spend their time outside of school, whether that be pursuing a hobby, volunteering, or simply relaxing. By forcing them into an activity, we may be limiting their ability to explore and develop their own interests.

Instead of mandating participation, I suggest that the school provides a variety of extracurricular activities for students to choose from and encourages students to participate in an activity that they are interested in. This approach will allow students to develop their skills and interests while also fostering a sense of community and school spirit.

In conclusion, while I understand the benefits of extracurricular activities, I disagree with the decision to mandate participation for all students. I believe that students should have the freedom to choose how they spend their time outside of school and that the school should provide opportunities for students to participate in activities they are interested in.",1
"Dear Principal,

I think it's a good idea to have a rule that kids have to have at least a B average to play sports or do other activities. Kids will try harder in school if they know they have to get good grades to play sports. It will also help them learn how to balance school and other things they like to do.

But, some kids might not be able to get a B average even if they try really hard. Maybe they have a learning disability or something else that makes it hard for them to learn. If they can't play sports or do other activities, they might feel sad and left out.

Also, some kids might be really good at sports or other activities, but they might not be as good at school. If they can't play sports or do other activities, they might not have anything to look forward to.

I think it's important to make sure that kids have a chance to participate in sports and other activities, even if they don't have a B average. Maybe there could be a way for kids to show that they are trying their best, even if their grades aren't as high as they could be.

"Dear friends,

Have you ever dreamed of adventure? Of seeing the world in a way that few others have? Then I have the perfect opportunity for you - the Seagoing Cowboys program!

I recently read an article about a man named Luke who participated in this program, and let me tell you, it sounds amazing. As a cowboy, Luke was able to ride the waves and visit unique places that most people can only dream of. And you can too!

One of the reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is the adventure. Luke got to ride on a ship and help take care of the animals on board. He even got to visit places like Hawaii and Japan! Can you imagine the stories you'll be able to tell your friends and family?

Another reason to join is the experience. Luke learned so much about the world and himself through this program. He learned about different cultures and how to take care of animals in a new environment. You'll gain valuable skills and knowledge that will stay with you for the rest of your life.

But don't just take my word for it! In the article, Luke said that he loved the sense of freedom he felt while on the ship. He also mentioned that he learned to appreciate the little things in life, like a warm bed and a home-cooked meal. These are the kind of experiences that will shape you into a better person.

So what are you waiting for? Join the Seagoing Cowboys program and have the adventure of a lifetime! You'll have the chance to see the world, learn new skills, and make memories that will last forever. Trust me, you won't regret it.

"Curfews are an important part of the teenage experience. Having a curfew can provide a sense of safety for adolescents, as well as set up good habits for the future. The primary focus of a curfew is to keep teenagers safe; as teenagers gain more freedom, curfews help enforce a range of limits that are necessary for their safety. A curfew also helps identify appropriate times for teens to come home, allowing parents to relax knowing when their children will be home and safe.

Another reason for a curfew is that it sets the stage for developing responsible habits. Sufficient sleep plays a vital role in teenagers' growth and development, and setting a reasonable curfew helps promote healthy sleeping habits. Additionally, having a curfew can instill respect for authority and encourage teens to take responsibility for their obligations.

Not everyone agrees that imposing a curfew is beneficial. Many people argue that curfews are too restrictive and infringe on teenagers’ freedom. It is important to consider these arguments when establishing a curfew for your teens. However, with the right amount of guidance and discussion, most families can work together to create an effective curfew that meets their needs. 

In conclusion, teenage curfews provide essential safety, promote healthy habits, and encourage responsibility. Although having a curfew might not be well-received by some teenagers, the long-term outcomes are worth the initial conflict.",1

"Title: The Power of Perseverance: Overcoming Failure to Achieve Success

Introduction:
Hey there! Let's talk about something that I think is super important - success! I mean, who doesn't want to be successful, right? But the thing is, failure is a part of the journey to success. Every successful person has faced failure at some point, but what sets them apart is their ability to overcome it. In this essay, I'm going to research some successful people and identify the points at which they overcame failure and stayed enthusiastic to achieve success. I'll also outline the factors that enabled them to achieve success and draw a comparison to my own life.

First up, let's talk about J.K. Rowling. She's the author of the Harry Potter series, which has sold millions of copies worldwide. But did you know that she was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book?! That's a lot of rejection, right? But she didn't give up. She kept writing and eventually found success. I can relate to this because I've had my fair share of rejection too. Like the time I tried out for the school play and didn't get the role I wanted. It was super disappointing, but I didn't give up. I kept practicing and eventually landed a smaller role. It's easy to get discouraged when things don't go our way, but it's important to keep trying.

Next, let's talk about Steve Jobs. He's the co-founder of Apple and is known for inventing the iPhone. But did you know that he was fired from the company he founded?! Yeah, it's true. But instead of giving up, he used that experience to fuel his passion and create something even better. He didn't let failure hold him back. I can relate to this because I've had a similar experience. Like the time I got a bad grade on a test and felt like I was a total failure. But I didn't let it get me down. I studied harder and eventually got a better grade on the next test. It's important to learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Preserving a Fair and Representative Presidential Election Process

Dear [State Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and college student residing in [Your State], I am writing to share my perspective on the debate surrounding whether to keep the Electoral College or switch to a system of election by popular vote for the President of the United States.

The Constitution established the Electoral College as a compromise between choosing the President through a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process consists of the selection of electors, who then vote for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress. I believe that despite its imperfections, the Electoral College offers several merits that make it worth preserving.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. Unlike a dispute over the popular vote, which is more likely to happen, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This discrepancy presents a safeguard against prolonged disputes over election results, which could undermine the stability and effective functioning of our democratic system.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's President."" Because no region has enough electoral votes to unilaterally elect a President, candidates must have trans-regional appeal. This requirement encourages candidates to campaign beyond their regional strongholds and consider the concerns and issues of diverse populations across the country. Consequently, it prevents a President from being solely accountable to a single region, ensuring a more comprehensive representation of the nation's interests.

Moreover, the Electoral College benefits swing states, where the outcome of elections can be more unpredictable. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states, which, in turn, encourages voters in those states to pay closer attention to the campaigns. This emphasis on swing states encourages higher voter engagement, as these voters are aware of their crucial role in determining the election's outcome. In contrast, a popular vote system might marginalize states with consistently predictable voting behaviors, leading to significant regions being overlooked by candidates.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political weight of large states compared to smaller ones. By apportioning electoral votes based on population, large states receive more attention from candidates during campaigns. This balance is vital in ensuring that the voices and concerns of citizens in both populous and less populous states are adequately represented in the electoral process.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the complications of run-off elections. In instances where no candidate can secure a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional rounds of voting and reduces the chances of diminishing public trust in the electoral process due to prolonged indecisiveness.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can be unfair, outdated, or even undemocratic, it is important to acknowledge that these claims are often based on theoretical concerns rather than real-world evidence. In fact, the Electoral College has successfully provided stable and reliable outcomes for the majority of presidential elections. The system has demonstrated its resilience, with the national popular vote differing from the electoral vote only a handful of times in history.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a cornerstone of our democracy, preserving fair representation and providing stability to the presidential election process. Its ""disaster factor"" is remarkably low, compared to potential chaos in a direct popular vote system. It ensures that presidential candidates appeal to diverse regions and actively engage with voters across the country, rather than focusing only on heavily populated urban areas. By addressing the concerns of swing states and balancing the political weight of large and small states, the Electoral College promotes a more inclusive and representative democracy.

I urge you, as our state senator, to consider these arguments when evaluating proposals to change or preserve the Electoral College. Keeping this system intact will protect the interests and voices of citizens in our state and across the nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing your continued dedication in serving our great state.

Sincerely,

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in presidential elections. While many argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves several crucial functions that ensure fairness, certainty, and representation in our democratic process.

Firstly, the Electoral College guarantees a certainty of outcome in presidential elections. The winner-take-all system employed by most states ensures that even a slight plurality in a state results in a landslide victory in terms of electoral votes. Despite its occasional disputes, the Electoral College has a proven track record of producing a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes. This avoids the complications and uncertainty that may arise from a direct popular vote, where a dispute over the outcome is more likely.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the president is a representative for all regions of the country. This system requires a candidate to have trans-regional appeal and prevents a candidate with solely regional support from winning the presidency. As a result, residents from all regions feel that their votes count and that the elected president will consider their interests. This is crucial for maintaining national unity and preventing the disenfranchisement of certain groups of voters.

Furthermore, the Electoral College directs campaign efforts towards swing states. This focus on swing states generates engagement and attention from the most thoughtful voters, as they are aware that their vote may sway the outcome of the election. This encourages candidates to address the concerns and needs of these voters, resulting in a more informed electorate and a candidate who has a comprehensive understanding of the diverse needs of the nation.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is its ability to give a fair weight to both large and small states. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate may lead to political imbalances, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive greater attention from candidates during campaigns. This grants citizens in larger states a sense of significance and influence in the election process, ultimately giving them a voice in electing the president.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process and prolong the decision-making time. By requiring a candidate to secure a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This streamlines the election process and avoids the costly and time-consuming efforts of organizing run-off elections.

Despite criticism from its opponents, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democratic system. It ensures certainty, representation, and fairness in presidential elections, while also allowing small and swing states to have a substantial say in the outcome. While there may be room for reforms within the Electoral College, abolishing it altogether would undermine the principles of our Constitution and erode the delicate balance of power among states.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that you will take my views into account when evaluating potential changes to the electoral process. Our democracy depends on a fair and effective system for electing our president, and I believe that the Electoral College continues to fulfill this role admirably.

Sincerely,

"As an 8th grader, I have to say that researching and writing this essay has been a really interesting experience. I learned a lot about what employers look for in potential employees and the benefits of hiring those with little to no experience.

First of all, let's talk about the common characteristics that employers look for in potential employees. These include things like teamwork, communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and a strong work ethic. Employers want to know that the person they hire will be able to work well with others, communicate effectively, and be able to solve problems as they arise. These are all important skills that can help a person succeed in any job.

Now, let's talk about the benefits of hiring candidates with little to no experience. One of the biggest benefits is that they are often more eager to learn and take on new challenges. They may not have as much knowledge or experience as someone else, but they are willing to put in the time and effort to learn and grow. This can be really valuable to employers, as it means they can train their employees and help them develop the skills they need to succeed.

However, there are also some cons to hiring candidates with limited experience. One of the biggest concerns is that they may not have the same level of expertise as someone else. They may not know as much about the job or the industry, which can make it harder for them to do their job well. Additionally, they may need more guidance and support, which can be time-consuming and costly for the employer.

So, how can those without experience successfully compete for job opportunities? One way is to highlight their transferable skills. Even if they don't have experience in a particular field, they may have skills that are relevant to the job. For example, if they have experience working in customer service, they may have developed strong communication and problem-solving skills that could be valuable in a different field.

Another way to successfully compete for job opportunities is to show enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Employers want to know that the person they hire is going to be motivated and committed to doing a good job. If they can show that they are eager to learn and take on new challenges, they are more likely to stand out from other",1
"Growing up I've always had a hard time being my true self in the world today. From the pressures of peers to the sometimes harsh judgements of society, it can be difficult to feel comfortable in your own skin. I remember my junior year of high school, when I was really struggling to stay true to my identity. I wanted so badly to follow the trends and fit in with the crowd, yet my inner voice kept reminding me that I didn't have to be like everyone else. It felt empowering to finally make that decision and embrace my true self, in spite of the pressure around me. 

Another moment that stands out to me is when I was in college and chose to focus my studies on philosophy and history, rather than the more typical path of business studies. This didn't sit too well with my family, however I knew it was my passion and I could not ignore it. It took a lot of courage for me to go against the grain and make the decision to pursue a degree in something that mattered to me.

Learning to be my true self was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. Though difficult at times, it was so worth it in the end. With every step I take towards embracing my true self, I feel more empowered and in tune with my identity. It's a liberating process that I couldn't recommend enough to others who are struggling to break their own barriers as well.",1
"Hi, my name is Bobby and I'm in 6th grade. Today I want to talk about homework. Some people think homework is good, others think it's bad. Me, I think homework is bad news.

First of all, homework takes up too much of my time. I get home from school at 3:15 and then I have to do homework for like 2 hours. That's a lot of time! I could be doing other things like playing outside, reading a book, or playing video games. But no, I have to sit there and do homework. It's not fair.

Second, homework is stressing me out. I don't like being stressed out, it makes me feel anxious and worried. And homework just piles on the stress. I have to make sure I do it all and do it right or I'll get in trouble. That's not cool.

Last, homework isn't really helping me learn. I mean, sure, it might help a little bit. But I already learn stuff in school, I don't need to do more work at home. Plus, I forget what I learned in school by the time I get home. So it's not like it's really helping me.

I think homework should be optional. If we want to do it, we can. If we don't want to, we don't have to. That way, people like me who don't like homework don't have to do it and people who like homework can do it if they want. It's fair.

So, that's my opinion on homework. I think it's not cool and we shouldn't have to do it. Thanks for reading my essay. Bye.",1
"The implementation of a four-day school week has been a topic of discussion for several years now. Some argue that it would benefit students, teachers, and the school community as a whole, while others believe that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of a four-day school week and determine whether it should be implemented at a school.

One of the main advantages of a four-day school week is that it would provide students with more time to focus on their studies. With fewer days in the week, students would have more time to complete their assignments and prepare for exams. This could lead to improved academic performance and a decrease in stress levels. Additionally, students would have more time to engage in extracurricular activities, such as sports and clubs, which could lead to a more well-rounded education.

Another advantage of a four-day school week is that it would provide teachers with more time to prepare for their lessons and assessments. With fewer days in the week, teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for their classes, which could lead to more engaging and effective lessons. Additionally, teachers would have more time to collaborate with their colleagues and engage in professional development, which could lead to improved teacher performance.

However, there are also several disadvantages to consider. One of the main disadvantages is that a four-day school week would require students to attend school for longer hours each day. This could lead to increased fatigue and decreased productivity. Additionally, a four-day school week would require students to attend school on Saturdays, which could lead to a decrease in attendance and a loss of weekends.

Another disadvantage of a four-day school week is that it could lead to a decrease in funding for schools. With fewer days in the week, schools would have less time to fundraise and secure grants. This could lead to a decrease in resources and a decrease in the quality of education. Additionally, a four-day school week could lead to a decrease in the number of teachers, as schools would have to pay teachers for the additional day of work.

In conclusion, the implementation of a four-day school week has both advantages and disadvantages. While it would provide students and teachers with more time to focus on their studies and engage in extracurricular activities, it would also require students",1
"Gun control is a really important issue that affects lots of people. I think it's important to have stricter gun control laws because it can help keep people safe.

One reason why we need stricter gun control laws is because of all the school shootings that have been happening. It's really scary for kids to go to school and worry about getting shot. If there were stricter gun control laws, it would be harder for people who might want to do something bad to get their hands on guns. This would make schools safer and help kids feel more secure.

Another reason why we need stricter gun control laws is because of all the people who get shot accidentally. Sometimes people might be playing with guns and not realize they're real, or they might accidentally leave a gun where a kid can find it. If there were stricter gun control laws, people would have to be more careful with their guns and make sure they're stored safely. This would help prevent accidents and save lives.

Some people might argue that stricter gun control laws would take away our right to defend ourselves. But I think that's not a good reason to have guns. If we have stricter gun control laws, we can still have guns for hunting and things like that, but we'll be safer because we'll know that only responsible people have guns.

I also think it's important to note that stricter gun control laws wouldn't take away all guns. It would just make it harder for people who might want to use guns for bad things to get them. There would still be guns for people who want to use them for good things, like hunting or protecting their families.

In conclusion, I think stricter gun control laws would help keep people safe and prevent accidents and school shootings. It's important to have responsible gun ownership and stricter gun control laws would help ensure that only responsible people have guns.",1
"Climate change is a very serious issue that affects us all. It's important that governments take immediate action to address it. There are many reasons why governments should take action, and I will explain some of them in this essay.

First of all, climate change is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and pollution. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause global temperatures to rise. This rise in temperature has many negative effects, such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and more frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. These effects not only harm the environment but also have devastating impacts on human societies and economies. For example, rising sea levels can flood coastal cities and towns, displacing thousands of people and causing billions of dollars in damage.

Secondly, climate change affects everyone, regardless of their race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. It's not a problem that can be solved by individuals or communities alone. Governments have the resources and authority to make a difference. They can implement policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, invest in renewable energy, and protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change. For instance, governments can impose carbon taxes on companies that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. They can also invest in clean energy sources like wind and solar power, which create new jobs and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

Thirdly, taking action on climate change is not only a moral and ethical responsibility, but it can also have economic benefits. Investing in clean energy and reducing carbon emissions can create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. In fact, many countries have already seen the benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. For example, Germany's transition to renewable energy has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and reduced their carbon emissions by 27%.

Finally, delaying action on climate change will only make things worse. The longer we wait, the more severe and irreversible the impacts of climate change will be. We have already seen the devastating effects of climate change in recent years, from hurricanes in the Caribbean to wildfires in Australia. Climate change is not a problem that we can ignore or put off for later. We must take action now, and governments have a critical role to play.

In conclusion, governments should take immediate action to address climate change. Climate change is a global problem that affects everyone, and governments have the resources and authority to make a difference. Taking action on climate change is not only a moral and ethical responsibility, but it can also have economic benefits. We cannot afford to delay action any longer. We must act now to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for all.",1
" I believe that the idea of finishing high school in three years is a great opportunity for students who want to pursue their dreams and have limited resources or responsibilities. This idea is particularly beneficial for Hispanic students who may not have the same opportunities as others to attend college or university.

One of the main reasons why some students do not attend high school is because they have to work to support themselves or their families. By finishing high school in three years, these students can have more time to focus on their studies and increase their chances of attending college or university. Additionally, this idea can also be beneficial for students who may not have the financial means to attend college or university, as they can complete their high school education in a shorter amount of time and potentially save money on tuition and fees.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to this idea. Completing high school in three years can be a challenging and stressful experience, as students will need to focus on their studies and work hard to achieve their goals. Additionally, this idea may not be feasible for all students, as some may not have the necessary support or resources to complete their high school education in such a short amount of time.

Despite these potential disadvantages, I believe that the idea of finishing high school in three years is a positive step towards providing more opportunities for students who want to pursue their dreams. This idea can help to level the playing field for students from different backgrounds and provide a more equitable education system.

Personally, I believe that this idea is particularly relevant for me. As a Hispanic student who has to work to support myself and my family, completing high school in three years would be a significant accomplishment. However, I also recognize that this idea may not be feasible for all students, and that it is important to ensure that all students have the necessary support and resources to succeed in their education.

In conclusion, I believe that the idea of finishing high school in three years is a positive step towards providing more opportunities for students who want to pursue their dreams. While there are potential disadvantages to this idea, I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks and that this idea can help to create a more equitable education system for all students.",1
"Privacy protections on social media is a super important thing that we need to think about. Like, I know that I share a lot of stuff online, but that doesn't mean that I want just anyone to see it. I mean, have you seen all the creeps and weirdos on Instagram? They're always trying to slide into your DMs and stuff. It's super gross.

So, yeah, I think we definitely need stronger privacy protections. Like, maybe we should be able to control who sees our stuff, like, actually control it, not just have those stupid privacy settings that never work. And maybe we should be able to delete stuff forever, instead of just having it hidden. That way, we can make sure that our personal information doesn't get out there and get used for bad things.

I know some people might say that privacy protections are a bad thing because they'll stop us from sharing information and connecting with each other. But, like, that's not true. We can still share stuff and connect with each other, but we should be able to do it safely and without worrying about our personal information getting out there.

And, honestly, I think it's kind of weird that we don't have stronger privacy protections already. Like, don't we deserve to have control over our own information? It's not like we're asking for too much. We just want to be able to share stuff online without worrying about it getting out of control.

So, yeah, I think we definitely need stronger privacy protections on social media. It's time for us to take control of our own information and make sure that it's safe.",1
"Single-use plastic products, such as straws, bags, and utensils, have been widely used for their convenience and affordability. However, their negative impacts on the environment have sparked debates about whether they should be banned or not. After considering the issue, I believe that single-use plastics should be banned due to their detrimental effects on the environment.

One reason why single-use plastics should be banned is that they contribute to the increasing pollution of our oceans and landfills. These items are often discarded after a single use, and many of them end up in the ocean, harming marine life and polluting the water. Additionally, single-use plastics take hundreds of years to decompose in landfills, causing long-term harm to the environment.

Furthermore, the production of single-use plastics requires large amounts of oil and other non-renewable resources, which contributes to climate change and other environmental problems. By reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, we can decrease our use of non-renewable resources and reduce our carbon footprint.

On the other hand, some people argue that banning single-use plastics is unnecessary and that people should have the freedom to choose what products they use. However, this argument overlooks the fact that our choices have consequences beyond our individual lives. The pollution caused by single-use plastics affects everyone and the planet as a whole.

In conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect the environment and reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources. While it may require some changes to our daily habits, the long-term benefits are worth it. We should all work towards reducing our use of single-use plastics and supporting sustainable alternatives.",1
"Dear Professor,

I believe that pairing older and younger students together is beneficial for both groups. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of this arrangement and provide examples to support my argument.

Firstly, pairing older and younger students allows for the exchange of knowledge and experience. Older students can share their knowledge and skills with younger students, while younger students can provide fresh perspectives and ideas to older students. For example, in a high school science class, a senior biology student could pair with a freshman to work on a research project. The senior could provide guidance and knowledge on scientific research methods, while the freshman could bring a new perspective on the project's topic.

Secondly, pairing older and younger students can help to build relationships and foster a sense of community. When students work together, they have the opportunity to get to know each other on a deeper level. This can lead to the formation of lasting friendships and a stronger sense of community within the classroom. For example, in a college English class, a junior could pair with a senior to work on a group project. The junior could benefit from the senior's experience and guidance, while the senior could benefit from the junior's enthusiasm and energy.

Finally, pairing older and younger students can help to break down stereotypes and promote understanding between different age groups. When students work together, they can challenge their assumptions and biases about others. This can lead to a more inclusive and accepting environment in the classroom. For example, in a middle school social studies class, a 6th-grade student could pair with an 8th-grade student to research a historical event. The 6th-grade student could benefit from the 8th-grade student's knowledge of the event, while the 8th-grade student could benefit from the 6th-grade student's perspective on the event's significance.

In conclusion, pairing older and younger students together is beneficial for both groups. It allows for the exchange of knowledge and experience, helps to build relationships and foster a sense of community, and breaks down stereotypes and promotes understanding between different age groups. I believe that schools should encourage this arrangement more often and provide opportunities for students to work together in this way.

"Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for both individuals and communities. The passages provided highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation. By implementing policies and initiatives to encourage car-free living, cities and suburbs can create more livable and sustainable environments.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the first passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a significant contribution to climate change and air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help combat these issues and work towards a more sustainable future.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris due to smog illustrates how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality. Cold nights and warm days can trap car emissions, resulting in smog that affects the health of residents. Implementing car-free initiatives can help reduce this pollution and create cleaner and healthier environments for individuals to live in.

Limiting car usage also encourages the use of public transportation and alternative modes of transportation such as biking and walking. The third passage discusses the successful car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a healthier lifestyle and decreases the reliance on cars. By prioritizing public transportation and creating pedestrian-friendly cities, we can improve accessibility for everyone and reduce the need for car ownership.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive effects on urban planning and the design of suburbs. The second passage describes the district of Vauban in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but there are limited parking spaces available. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own a car. This approach encourages walking and cycling by placing stores within walking distance and creating compact communities. By reimagining the design of suburbs and prioritizing accessibility to public transportation and amenities, we can create more sustainable and livable communities.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, as highlighted in the passages. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable environments. Implementing car-free initiatives and prioritizing public transportation can lead to healthier and more accessible communities. It is important for individuals and governments to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards a future with reduced car dependency.",1
"Ummm... hey there!  So, like, finding out who you are and what your purpose in life is, it's like, a super deep and important thing, you know?  Like, it's not easy, but it's definitely worth it. 

First of all, I think it's important to consider your family. They're like, the people who raised you and love you no matter what, right?  They can give you a lot of insight into who you are and what you're good at, and they can also help you figure out what you want to do with your life.  Like, my family is super supportive and they always encourage me to be myself, so that's like, really helpful.

But, like, friends are also important, you know?  They can give you different perspectives and help you see things from different angles. They can also be like, a sounding board for your ideas and help you figure out what you want to do with your life.  Like, my friends are always there for me and they never judge me, so that's like, really cool.

And then there's society,  Like, it can be really hostile and unsupportive sometimes.  There are a lot of expectations and pressures, and it can be hard to fit in and be yourself at the same time.  But, like, it's important to remember that you don't have to conform to what society wants you to be.  You can be yourself and be proud of it, even if it's not what everyone else is doing. 

And finally, there's your own inner voice,  Like, that little voice inside your head that tells you what you want and what's important to you.  It's easy to ignore it sometimes, but it's important to listen to it and follow your heart.  Like, I know what I want to do with my life, and I'm going to go for it, no matter what anyone else says.

"Living an active life and a lazy life provide drastically different experiences. An active lifestyle gives the individual opportunities to experience new and exciting activities. Going to the gym, hiking, biking, joining a club or sport, and providing volunteering services are some of the many experiences one can gain from living an active life. Additionally, an active life style has the benefit of improving physical and mental health, as well as establishing a strong social circle. On the other hand, living a lazy lifestyle can provide the individual with experiences such as unwinding and spending more time alone. Binge-watching television, spending time gaming, and sleeping in are some of the likely activities found in a lazy lifestyle. While this type of lifestyle can be relaxing, it often does not provide the same energy levels and sense of accomplishment that living an active lifestyle can provide. 

Therefore, an active lifestyle can provide more diverse experiences, while a lazy lifestyle can provide more relaxing and less active experiences. However, both lifestyles have advantages and disadvantages. Active lifestyles often require more energy, commitment, and potentially money, while lazy lifestyles require less effort overall and less planning. Ultimately, the decision of what type of lifestyle to pursue is up to the individual, and it’s important to consider the benefits and drawbacks of each before making a decision.",1
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so I know some people might think it's weird that I'm writing about phones in school, but hear me out. We should be able to use our phones during lunch and free time. I know some people are like, ""But it's distracting!"" or ""It's against the rules!"" but I think it's actually pretty cool.

First of all, let's talk about why we even have phones in the first place. We got them so we could stay in touch with our friends and family, right? And we're always checking our phones to see if we got any new messages or notifications. So why can't we use them during lunch and free time? It's not like we're gonna be on them the whole time, but it's nice to be able to check in with people when we want to. Plus, it's not like we're gonna be playing games or anything, we can just use them to talk to people.

And think about it, if we're not allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time, it's like we're being punished for something we didn't even do. It's like, we're not allowed to have our phones because the teachers are worried we're gonna get distracted or something. But like, we can get distracted by anything, not just our phones. We could be distracted by the TV, or the other kids, or even the food. So it's not like our phones are the only thing that can distract us.

And another thing, if we're allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time, it's like we're being given more freedom. We're not just stuck in class all day, we get to have some time to ourselves to do whatever we want. And if we want to use our phones during that time, that's fine. It's not like we're gonna be the only ones using them, either. There are gonna be other people who want to use their phones too, so it's not",1
"I think it's a good idea for schools to let parents see their kids' grades and attendance online. It's important for parents to know how their kids are doing in school so they can help them if they need it. For example, if a kid is struggling in a certain subject, their parents can help them get a tutor or work with them to improve their grades. It also helps parents to know if their kid is missing a lot of school, that way they can address any issues that might be causing their child to miss school.

Also, it's a good way to teach kids responsibility, if they know that their parents can see their grades and attendance, they will try their best to keep their grades up and attend school regularly. It's like having a contract between the school, parents, and students.

On the other hand, some kids might feel like their privacy is being invaded, and they might not like the idea of their parents being able to see everything they do in school. But, it's important for parents to be involved in their kids' education and to know what's going on in their lives.

In addition, schools can set up a system where students have to give permission for their parents to see their grades and attendance, that way students have some control over their own privacy.

In conclusion, I believe that it's a good idea for schools to let parents monitor their children's grades and attendance online. It helps parents to be involved in their kids' education and helps kids to be more responsible.",1
"As an 8th grader, I'm excited to research the various job opportunities available to me after high school. It's important to know what options are out there so I can make informed decisions about my future. After researching, I found that there are many pros and cons to each occupation, and two that really interest me are being a software developer and a nurse.

Being a software developer sounds like a great job because it's in high demand and can be done remotely. I could work from home and still make a good living. Plus, I enjoy learning new things and problem-solving, which are skills that are essential for this job. However, it can be stressful and require long hours, which might not be for everyone.

On the other hand, being a nurse is also a great option. Nurses are always in demand and can work in a variety of settings, from hospitals to clinics. It's a job that's both rewarding and stable, and I could make a real difference in people's lives. Plus, it's a job that's not too stressful, which is important to me. However, it can be emotionally challenging at times, and I might have to work long hours or night shifts.

I think schools can better provide students with career choices by offering more career counseling and job shadowing opportunities. This would help students like me learn more about different occupations and figure out what we're interested in. It would also be helpful if schools provided more resources for students who are interested in specific fields, such as software development or nursing. This could include internships or mentorship programs that would give us hands-on experience and help us build connections in our chosen fields.

It's important for students to attend school to ensure future success because it provides us with the skills and knowledge we need to succeed in our chosen careers. School teaches us how to problem-solve, communicate effectively, and work well with others, which are all essential skills for any job. Additionally, attending school gives us access to resources and opportunities that we might not have otherwise, such as internships, job shadowing, and career counseling.

In conclusion, there are many job opportunities available to students after high school, and it",1
"Collaboration in the Roman and Islamic Empires

Collaboration is a crucial aspect of any project or decision-making process. It involves working together with multiple people to achieve a common goal. In the Roman and Islamic Empires, collaboration played a significant role in the success and growth of these empires. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of collaborating with multiple people on a project or when seeking advice, discuss an instance in which asking multiple people for input was beneficial, analyze the benefits of combining different ideas to create a better solution, and explain why it is important to understand information before creating a solution.

One of the main advantages of collaboration is the ability to combine different skills and perspectives. Each person brings their unique strengths and weaknesses to the table, and by working together, the group can leverage these strengths to achieve the best possible outcome. For example, in the Roman Empire, collaboration between soldiers, engineers, and architects was essential in the construction of roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure projects. The soldiers provided the labor, the engineers designed the structures, and the architects ensured that the designs were aesthetically pleasing. By working together, the Romans were able to create a network of infrastructure that allowed their empire to expand rapidly.

Another advantage of collaboration is the ability to seek advice from multiple people. When making a decision, it is important to consider different perspectives and seek advice from people with expertise in the relevant area. In the Islamic Empire, collaboration between scholars, traders, and rulers was essential in the development of Islamic law and the expansion of the empire. Scholars provided the legal framework, traders provided the economic knowledge, and rulers provided the political leadership. By working together, the Islamic Empire was able to create a legal and economic system that was both just and prosperous.

One instance in which asking multiple people for input was beneficial was during the construction of the Great Wall of China. The wall was a massive project that required the input of many different people, including soldiers, engineers, and architects. By working together, the builders were able to create a structure that was both strong and aesthetically pleasing. The wall also served as a symbol of Chinese strength and unity, which helped to unite the empire and deter invaders.

Combining different ideas is another advantage of collaboration. When people with different perspectives work together, they can",1
"Spending time outdoors has many advantages. From physical exercise to mental health benefits, going outdoors can have a wide ranging positive impact. Outdoor activities include sports, walking, and cycling to name a few. Outdoor games such as Touch football and Capture the Flag offer exciting opportunities for groups of people to go outside and enjoy while getting healthy exercise. Without a balanced amount of outdoor time, people can be prone to lack of motivation and even depression. This may be due to people's saturation or over-dependence on indoor activities such as gaming. Listening to music outdoors can be a pleasant and rewarding experience. However, it is important to take safety precautions such as wearing earplugs and avoiding loud noise. It is also important to be aware of the weather and any potential dangers, like slippery surfaces. Overall, there are numerous reasons to go outdoors and reap the rewards of the experience.",1
"It is undeniable that technology has had a profoundly positive effect on people's lives in the modern era. Technology has made activities such as communication and information gathering easier than ever before. We can now connect with people from across the world with the click of a button, allowing us to form relationships and gain knowledge on a global scale. We now have access to virtually unlimited information and resources that can be used to educate, entertain and even save lives. 

Technology has also played a key role in advancing medicine, science and engineering. The modern medical field is largely reliant on technology for diagnoses and treatments, and inventions such as the MRI scanner have been crucial in the advancement of medical science. Technology has also been integral in the development of technological innovations such as faster and more powerful computers, improved agricultural techniques, and better ways to harness renewable energy sources. 

Additionally, technology has made everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. We can now buy things online rather than take a trip to the store. We can stream movies and music without needing any physical media. We can even use technology to control our own homes, by automated lighting, climate control, and even security systems. 

Ultimately, technology has had a largely positive effect on the lives of people across the world. From connecting us with one another to saving lives, technology has positively impacted our lives in countless ways.",1
"The idea of a four-day school week has been gaining popularity in recent years, and it has sparked a debate about its potential benefits and drawbacks. While some people believe that it would be beneficial for students, others argue that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will investigate the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing the ""four-day school week"" idea.

One of the main benefits of the four-day school week is that it would reduce the amount of stress on students. Many students today are under a lot of pressure to perform well in school, and this can lead to stress and anxiety. By having an extra day off each week, students would have more time to relax and recharge, which could help reduce their stress levels. This could lead to better mental health and overall well-being.

Another potential benefit of the four-day school week is that it would give students more time for other activities. With an extra day off each week, students would have more time to pursue hobbies and interests outside of school. This could lead to more well-rounded individuals who are not only academically successful but also have a variety of other skills and experiences. Additionally, students would have more time to spend with their families and friends, which could strengthen their relationships and social skills.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to the four-day school week. One of the main concerns is that it could lead to a lack of time for other activities. If students are not in school for four days each week, they may not have enough time to complete all of their schoolwork or participate in extracurricular activities. This could lead to a decline in academic performance and a decrease in the number of students participating in extracurricular activities.

Another potential drawback of the four-day school week is that it could have a negative impact on students' future success. If students are not in school for four days each week, they may not have enough time to develop the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in the future. This could lead to a decrease in the number of students who go on to college or pursue advanced degrees.

In conclusion, the four-day school week is an idea that has both potential benefits and drawbacks. While it could reduce stress levels and give students more time for other activities, it could also lead to a lack of time for other activities",1
"Title: The Power of Positive Thinking: Unlocking Success in Life

Hey there, folks!  Today, I wanna talk about something that's really important to me – positive thinking.  You know, that whole ""attitude is everything"" thingamajig.  It's like, if you have a positive outlook on life, good things will happen, right?  And I'm not just talking about little things like getting that cool new toy you've been wanting.  Nope, I'm talking about BIG things like success in life! 

So, let me tell you why I think positive thinking is so important.  First of all, it helps you stay motivated.  When you're positive, you're more likely to take risks and try new things.  Like, if you're trying out for the school play, and you're feeling confident, you're more likely to give it your all and do your best.  And if you do your best, you're more likely to get the part! 

Another thing is, positive thinking can help you deal with challenges.  Like, let's say you're struggling in a particular subject, and you start to feel like you're never gonna get it.  But if you're positive, you're more likely to keep trying, and eventually, you'll figure it out!  And then you'll be like, ""Hey, I did it!  I'm so proud of myself!"" 

And lastly, positive thinking can help you make better choices.  Like, if you're trying to decide which college to go to, and you're feeling all stressed out, if you're positive, you're more likely to choose the one that's gonna make you happy in the long run.  And trust me, you don't wanna end up in a college that's not for you.  That'd",1
"""I do not have a personal opinion, but i can provide some arguments for and against the issue of distance learning.

on the one hand, distance learning can offer students flexibility and convenience. for instance, students who live far away from school, have physical disabilities or illnesses, or need to work part-time to support their families, can benefit from attending classes from home. they can save time and money on commuting, have more control over their schedule, and avoid distractions or bullying at school.

moreover, distance learning can also promote self-discipline, self-motivation, and self-directed learning. students need to manage their time effectively, communicate with their peers and teachers remotely, and take responsibility for their learning outcomes. they can develop valuable skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy that are essential for the 21st-century workforce.

on the other hand, distance learning can also have some drawbacks. for example, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their classmates and teachers, miss out on social interaction and hands-on activities, and struggle with technical issues or lack of support. they may also face distractions at home, such as family members, pets, or household chores, that can interfere with their learning.

in addition, distance learning requires adequate resources and infrastructure, such as reliable internet connection, computers, and software, that not all students may have access to. it can also pose challenges for teachers who need to adapt their teaching strategies, provide feedback, and assess student performance remotely.

in conclusion, distance learning can be a viable option for some students who have specific needs or circumstances. however, it should be carefully planned, implemented, and evaluated to ensure that it meets the academic and social-emotional needs of all students and supports their overall well-being.""",1
" The place in the world that I would most like to visit is France. I have always been fascinated by the French language and culture, and I believe that visiting France would give me a deeper understanding of both.

One of the main reasons I would like to visit France is because I have always been drawn to the country's rich history and culture. From the stunning architecture of the Louvre Museum to the iconic Eiffel Tower, I would love to explore all that France has to offer.

In addition to the museums and landmarks, I would also be interested in learning more about the daily lives of the French people. I would love to experience their holiday traditions, such as Christmas, and to try their local cuisine. I would also be interested in learning more about the French education system and how it compares to other countries.

Overall, I believe that visiting France would be an enriching and fulfilling experience that would give me a deeper appreciation for the country's language, culture, and people.",1
"Enthusiasm is an essential element of achieving success in any aspect of life. It is the driving force that propels individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. In this essay, I will argue that enthusiasm has a significant impact on success and provide examples of Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother to support this claim.

Firstly, enthusiasm is the spark that ignites the fire of motivation. It is the passion that drives individuals to pursue their dreams and work towards achieving their goals. Without enthusiasm, individuals may lose interest in their pursuits and give up too easily. Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest soccer players of all time, has always been known for his enthusiasm on the field. He is constantly moving, shouting, and encouraging his teammates, which has helped him to become one of the most successful soccer players in history.

Secondly, enthusiasm helps individuals to overcome challenges and setbacks. It is the ability to stay positive and keep pushing forward even when things get tough. My mother is a perfect example of this. She has always been enthusiastic about her job as a nurse, and even when she faced challenges and setbacks, she never lost her enthusiasm. She continued to work hard and provide the best care possible to her patients. As a result, she has been successful in her career and has made a positive impact on the lives of many people.

Thirdly, enthusiasm helps individuals to be more productive and efficient. When individuals are enthusiastic about their work, they are more likely to be focused and motivated. They are more likely to put in the effort required to achieve their goals. Cristiano Ronaldo is a perfect example of this. He is known for his work ethic and his enthusiasm on the field, which has helped him to become one of the most successful soccer players of all time.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is an essential element of achieving success in any aspect of life. It is the driving force that propels individuals to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. Cristiano Ronaldo and my mother are perfect examples of how enthusiasm can have a significant impact on success. They both have always been enthusiastic about their pursuits and have worked hard to achieve their goals. As a result, they have both been successful in their respective fields and have made a positive impact on the lives of many people.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to graduate high school a year early. While it may seem like a great idea to allow students to graduate early and move on to the next chapter of their lives, there are several reasons why this should not be the case.

First and foremost, graduating high school a year early can have a negative impact on a student's academic performance. High school is a time when students are expected to take challenging classes and complete complex assignments. When students are rushed to graduate, they may not have enough time to fully understand and master the material they need to succeed in college. This can lead to poor grades and a lack of preparedness for the next level of education.

Additionally, graduating high school a year early can also impact a student's social and emotional development. High school is a time when students are learning to navigate complex social situations and develop important life skills. When students graduate early, they may not have enough time to fully develop these skills and may struggle to adapt to the challenges of college and beyond.

Furthermore, graduating high school a year early can also impact a student's financial situation. College tuition and fees can be expensive, and students who graduate early may not have enough time to save up enough money to pay for their education. This can lead to financial stress and may force students to choose less expensive colleges or even drop out altogether.

In conclusion, graduating high school a year early may seem like a great idea, but it can have negative consequences for students' academic performance, social and emotional development, and financial situation. It is important for students to take their time and fully prepare for the next level of education, rather than rushing to graduate and move on to the next chapter of their lives.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always believed that having a longer school day for high school students would be beneficial. However, after conducting research, I have come to the conclusion that while there are some advantages, there are also potential disadvantages to having a two-hour longer school day.

One of the main advantages of having a longer school day is that it would give students more time to learn the subject material. With more time to study, students would be able to absorb more information and retain it better. This would lead to better grades, which would be beneficial for students in the long run. Additionally, having more time to study would allow students to work at their own pace, which would be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with the material.

Another advantage of having a longer school day is that it would give students more time to participate in extracurricular activities. Many students are interested in participating in sports, music, and other extracurricular activities, but they often struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. A longer school day would give students more time to participate in these activities, which would be beneficial for their social and emotional development.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to having a longer school day. One potential disadvantage is that students may become burned out. With more time to study, students may become overwhelmed and stressed, which could lead to burnout. Additionally, some students may struggle to adjust to the new schedule, which could lead to disruptions in their daily routines.

Another potential disadvantage of having a longer school day is that it could lead to a decrease in the quality of education. If students are not given adequate time to rest and recharge, their cognitive abilities may suffer. This could lead to a decrease in the quality of education, as students may not be able to fully absorb the material.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to having a longer school day for high school students, there are also potential disadvantages. It is important for schools to carefully consider the pros and cons of having a longer school day and to make a decision that is best for their students. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide students with the best possible education, while also taking into account their social and emotional well-being.",1
"As technology continues to advance, it has become increasingly important for individuals to consider the impact of limitations in human contact due to technology use. While technology has brought many benefits to our lives, such as improved communication and access to information, it has also had negative effects on our physical and mental health, social relationships, and economic well-being.

One of the most significant negative effects of technology on human contact is the impact on physical health. Spending too much time sitting in front of screens can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Additionally, technology use has been linked to poor posture, eye strain, and other physical discomforts that can negatively impact overall health.

In terms of mental health, technology use has both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, technology has made it easier for individuals to connect with others and seek support when they need it. However, excessive technology use has also been linked to increased feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression. This can be particularly problematic for young people who are still developing their social skills and may rely heavily on technology for communication and social interaction.

Another important aspect to consider is the impact of technology on social relationships. While technology has made it easier for individuals to connect with others, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions. This can make it more difficult for individuals to build and maintain meaningful relationships, and can also lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

Finally, it is important to consider the economic effects of technology use on human contact. While technology has created new job opportunities and industries, it has also led to the decline of certain jobs and industries that rely on human interaction. This can have a significant impact on the economy and on individuals who may struggle to find work in these industries.

In conclusion, while technology has brought many benefits to our lives, it is important to consider the negative effects of limitations in human contact due to technology use. By understanding the impact on physical and mental health, social relationships, and economic well-being, individuals can make more informed decisions about their technology use and strive to maintain a healthy balance between technology and human interaction.",1
"Hey there!  Uh, so, you know, making good choices is like, super important in life.  Like, it can affect our personal lives, our families, and our futures. 

So, let's start with personal lives. When we make bad decisions, it can lead to problems like stress, anxiety, and depression.  Like, who wants to be sad all the time? Not me, that's for sure!  But seriously, bad choices can damage our relationships with friends and family, and even lead to health problems.  Who wants to be stuck in a toxic relationship or have a bad influence on our loved ones? Not me! 

And don't even get me started on the effects on our families.  When we make poor decisions, it can lead to financial problems, which can put a lot of stress on our families.  Like, who wants to struggle to make ends meet? Not me!  But even worse, bad choices can lead to family conflicts and division.  Who wants to see their family suffer because of their mistakes? Not me! 

But wait, it gets even worse!  Bad decisions can also affect our futures.  Like, think about it. When we make poor choices, it can limit our opportunities and prevent us from reaching our full potential.  Who wants to be stuck in a dead-end job or have a limited social life? Not me!  And worst of all, bad decisions can lead to regret and disappointment.  Who wants to look back on their life and think, ""What if I had made different choices?""  Not me! 

So, what can we do to avoid all these negative consequences?  Well, the answer is simple: make good choices!  It's not always easy, but it's worth it.  When we make good decisions, it can lead to a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling life. *n",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that the decision of how many extracurricular activities a student should take should be left to the student and their family members. While schools may have concerns about the impact of extracurricular activities on homework and study time, I believe that the benefits of participating in multiple activities outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Firstly, participating in multiple extracurricular activities can help a student develop a wide range of skills and interests. For example, joining a school club or sports team can provide opportunities to learn leadership, teamwork, and communication skills, while also allowing the student to explore their passions and hobbies. Additionally, participating in multiple activities can help a student build a diverse and well-rounded resume, which can be beneficial when applying for colleges or scholarships.

Furthermore, participating in multiple extracurricular activities can also help a student develop a sense of community and belonging. Joining a club or team can provide opportunities to meet new people and form lasting friendships. Additionally, participating in multiple activities can help a student feel more connected to their school and community, which can be beneficial for their overall mental and emotional well-being.

While schools may worry that extracurricular activities can affect a student's academic performance, I believe that this concern is often overblown. In fact, research has shown that participation in extracurricular activities can actually improve a student's academic performance, as it can help them develop important study skills and time management strategies. Additionally, many schools offer study skills workshops and tutoring services to help students balance their academic and extracurricular commitments.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the decision of how many extracurricular activities a student should take should be left to the student and their family members. Participating in multiple activities can provide numerous benefits, including the development of important skills and interests, a sense of community and belonging, and improved academic performance. While schools may have concerns about the impact of extracurricular activities on homework and study time, I believe that these concerns are often unfounded, and that the benefits of participation in multiple activities far outweigh any potential drawbacks.",1
"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about my future and what I want to do after high school. Some people might think that graduating early is a good idea, but I'm not so sure.

One advantage of graduating early is that you get to explore different career paths before everyone else. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can take some college classes and get a head start on your education. Or, if you want to be an artist, you can take some art classes and get a feel for what it's like to be in college. This can be really helpful because you can figure out what you want to do and what you're good at before everyone else does.

Another advantage is that you get to take some extra classes and get a head start on your education. This can be really helpful if you want to get into a good college or if you want to learn something new. For example, you can take a math class or a science class and get a better understanding of the material before everyone else.

But there are also some disadvantages to graduating early. One of the biggest disadvantages is that you might not be ready for the workload of college. College is a lot harder than high school, and if you're not used to it, you might struggle to keep up. Additionally, you might not have as much time to relax and have fun, which can be really important for your mental health.

Another disadvantage is that you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have if you stayed in high school for another year. For example, you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends or to participate in extracurricular activities. This can be really sad because you might miss out on some of the best times of your life.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to graduating early, there are also some disadvantages. It's important to think carefully about your decision and make sure that you're ready for the challenges of college before you decide to graduate early.",1
" Are we the future? Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I believe that this statement holds true, even in today's rapidly changing world. While technology and social norms have brought about significant changes in our lives, they have also created challenges that we must overcome to be true to ourselves.

Firstly, the constant advancements in technology have brought about new ways of communicating and connecting with others. While these new technologies have made our lives easier in many ways, they have also created new expectations and pressures. For example, social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and we are constantly bombarded with messages about how we should present ourselves online. This has led to a culture of comparison and conformity, where we feel the need to constantly compare ourselves to others and fit in with the norms of the online community.

Secondly, we are all part of a larger society that has its own norms and expectations. These norms can be both written and unwritten, and they can have a significant impact on our lives. For example, laws and regulations are written norms that we must follow to avoid legal consequences. However, there are also unwritten norms that we follow in our daily lives, such as dress codes and social etiquette. These norms can limit our self-expression and prevent us from pursuing our passions.

In conclusion, I believe that Emerson's quote holds true today. Being true to ourselves in a world that is constantly trying to make us something else is indeed the greatest accomplishment. While technology and social norms have brought about significant changes in our lives, they have also created challenges that we must overcome to be true to ourselves. By embracing new technologies and following social norms, we can maintain balance and order in our society, and leave a better future for our children.",1
"In my opinion, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. This is because I think that students know themselves better and they are more aware of what they want to learn or improve. If students design their own projects, they will be more invested in it and will work harder to achieve their goals.

For example, if a student wants to learn how to play an instrument, they can design a project where they practice playing for a certain amount of time every day or week. This way, they will be motivated to learn and improve their skills. On the other hand, if the project is designed by a teacher, there might not be enough interest or motivation to complete it, which could lead to less learning.

Furthermore, if a student designs their own project, they will have the opportunity to be more creative and innovative. They can come up with unique ideas and ways of learning, which will make the project more exciting and enjoyable. This will also help them develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed because it will allow them to have more control and ownership of their learning. They will be able to choose what they want to learn and how they want to learn it, which will lead to better learning outcomes.",1
"The story of the tortoise and the rabbit is a timeless lesson of the power of hard work, determination, and taking action. The tale gives us a powerful perspective on the importance of taking steady action to achieve our goals. In the story, the tortoise was determined to win the race and took consistent and steady action toward that goal, and the rabbit was distracted and ultimately stopped moving, thus allowing the tortoise to win.  

This story can be applied to two contrasting students taking summer vacation. The first student starts work on a task from the beginning of the vacation, while the other student relaxes and does not take action until the end. The student who takes action will have greater success in completing the task than the student who does not take action. Taking consistent and steady action will give them the resilience required to navigate potential challenges, pitfalls, and moments of doubt. 

Ultimately, the lesson of the tortoise and the rabbit gives us insight into the importance of time and how we can make it effective by doing something. Taking consistent action prevents failure and allows us to make progress towards our goals. We can all benefit from this story by reminding ourselves to take action and stay determined in order to succeed in anything we set out to do.",1

Sticking to a certain career path before completing high school can certainly bring advantages, such as having a clear direction and goal to work towards, as well as focusing on the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in that area. On the other hand, however, committing to a career at such a young age can be incredibly limiting. You may find yourself stuck in a certain path for longer than you would like and miss out on the opportunity to explore different career options. Furthermore, committing to a career at a young age can also mean sacrificing important skills related to communication, teamwork, and interpersonal interaction, all of which are increasingly important for success in the modern job market.",1
"Enthusiasm is a crucial component of overcoming failure. It is the driving force that propels individuals to keep going even when faced with adversity. Without enthusiasm, it becomes difficult to maintain motivation and persist in the face of obstacles. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of enthusiasm in overcoming failure and provide an example to illustrate my point.

Firstly, enthusiasm provides individuals with the energy and drive to continue working towards their goals. When faced with failure, it is easy to become discouraged and give up. However, enthusiasm allows individuals to maintain a positive attitude and keep pushing forward. This is evident in the story of Thomas Edison, who famously failed thousands of times before finally inventing the light bulb. Despite the numerous failures, Edison remained enthusiastic about his work and continued to experiment until he finally succeeded.

Secondly, enthusiasm helps individuals to view failure as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. When individuals are enthusiastic about their work, they are more likely to see failure as a chance to learn and improve. This mindset allows individuals to continue working towards their goals without becoming discouraged. For example, when I took a science class in middle school, I failed my first test. However, instead of becoming discouraged, I used the opportunity to review the material and improve my understanding. With enthusiasm and a positive attitude, I was able to achieve an A on my next test.

Finally, enthusiasm provides individuals with the resilience to bounce back from failure. When individuals are enthusiastic about their work, they are more likely to persist in the face of adversity. This resilience allows individuals to overcome setbacks and continue working towards their goals. For example, when I started my own business, I faced numerous challenges and setbacks. However, I remained enthusiastic about my work and continued to persevere. With hard work and determination, my business was able to overcome these challenges and achieve success.

In conclusion, enthusiasm is a crucial component of overcoming failure. It provides individuals with the energy, drive, and resilience needed to continue working towards their goals. By maintaining a positive attitude and viewing failure as a learning opportunity, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve success. As the famous saying goes, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" With",1
" Yes, I can identify with Winston Churchill and his statement that in order to achieve our goals, we must endure hardships.

To reach our objectives, whether short-term or long-term, we must first overcome obstacles. If we want to see the results of success in our lives, we must never lose our enthusiasm for it. The journey to achieving our goals is fantastic, as only those who have fought for them know the challenges they had to overcome to reach their objectives.

As a support system for others who need help reaching their goals, it can be difficult to motivate ourselves to pursue our own objectives. However, we must remember that life is hard, and nothing is easy, but it is not impossible. To maintain our enthusiasm and determination, we can seek inspiration from others or seek out a mentor to guide us.

I believe that every person who has achieved a goal has faced obstacles along the way. These challenges can be daunting, but they are also opportunities for growth and self-improvement. They help us build character and change the way we view life.

Success is not an easy feat, but it is a rewarding one. It takes hard work, dedication, and perseverance to achieve our goals. Being successful is something that we must work towards, and it is a blessing to be able to share our knowledge and experience with others to help them achieve their own goals.

In conclusion, achieving our goals requires us to endure hardships and overcome obstacles. These challenges can be difficult to face, but they are also opportunities for growth and self-improvement. By maintaining our enthusiasm and determination, seeking inspiration from others, and working hard towards our goals, we can achieve success and make a positive impact on the world.",1
"I personally believe that zoos should continue to operate because they play an important role in conservation and education. Zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species, where they can live and breed without fear of habitat destruction or poaching. In the wild, these animals may not survive due to various threats, but in captivity, they have a better chance of survival.

Zoos also serve as a platform for educating people about different species of animals and their importance in our ecosystem. They offer educational programs and tours that help visitors understand the behavior, habitat, and needs of various animals. This knowledge helps create awareness and encourages people to take action towards protecting these species and their habitats.

Moreover, many zoos conduct research on animal behavior, physiology, and genetics. This research contributes to our understanding of these animals and helps us develop better strategies for their conservation. For example, the research conducted on giant pandas in captivity led to the development of successful breeding programs, which have increased the population of this endangered species.

While there are some concerns about the welfare of animals in zoos, most modern zoos prioritize the well-being of their animals. They provide them with large enclosures, nutritious food, and medical care when needed. Additionally, many zoos participate in breeding programs aimed at reintroducing endangered species into the wild.

In conclusion, zoos play a crucial role in conservation and education. They provide a safe haven for endangered species, educate people about the importance of wildlife conservation, and contribute to research that helps protect these species. While improvements can always bemade to ensure the best care for animals in zoos, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and zoos should continue to operate.",1
"As the debate over how to best enhance the educational system rages on, one potential solution that has recently captivated the attention of many is extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Supporters of this plan point to the potential benefits, such as students having more time to dedicate to mastering core material and teachers having the opportunity to provide more personalized instruction and one-on-one time. They also point out the potential for creative activities, such as extracurriculars, clubs, and field trips, to be better integrated into the structure of a shortened school week.

However, upping the amount of time our children spend at school can also have some unwanted side effects. For one, students may feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the amount of schoolwork and homework they must take on with the extended school day. In addition, lack of sleep, an unhealthy diet, and increased exposure to stress can all lead to poor academic performance. Furthermore, there may be costs associated with the shift to a four-day week that are too expensive for some families.

Ultimately, it is crucial that all stakeholders—parents, teachers, administrators, and students—come together and carefully weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day two hours in a four-day week before enacting any changes. It is only through discussion and thoughtful deliberation that we can ensure that such changes will be made in the best interest of our children’s education.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that the requirement for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can have both positive and negative effects on our school and society.

On the one hand, requiring all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can have a positive impact on our school community. It can encourage students to get involved in their school and community, and can help them develop new skills and interests. Additionally, it can help students develop social skills and teamwork, which are important for success in the future.

On the other hand, requiring all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can also have negative effects. For example, some students may not have the time or resources to participate in an extracurricular activity, which can cause stress and make it difficult for them to keep up with their grades. Additionally, some students may not be interested in the extracurricular activity, which can make it difficult for them to enjoy their time and be motivated to participate.

Overall, I believe that requiring all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can have both positive and negative effects on our school and society. It is important for schools to consider the individual needs and interests of their students, and to provide a variety of extracurricular activities to choose from. Additionally, schools should provide resources and support for students who may not have the time or resources to participate in an extracurricular activity.

In conclusion, requiring all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can have both positive and negative effects on our school and society.

" Have you ever been tasked with teaching a group of elementary students a lesson? If so, you may have been asked to teach them about multiplying and dividing. These two operations are essential for solving many everyday problems, including calculating the cost of groceries, determining if you have a discount, and even working with fractions.

Let's start with multiplying. This operation is incredibly useful when you need to find out how much something costs. For example, if you're planning a party and need to know how much it will cost for 4 bags of chips, multiplying can help you quickly calculate the total cost. Similarly, if you're shopping for a new car and need to know how much it will cost after a discount, multiplying can help you find out the new cost and how much money you saved.

Moving on to dividing, this operation is equally important when it comes to figuring out how much you're getting for your money. For instance, if you're buying a new pair of shoes and see that they're on sale, you can use dividing to find out the new cost after the discount. This way, you can determine how much money you saved and whether the discount was worth it.

Finally, let's talk about fractions. Multiplying and dividing fractions are essential for understanding how to add and subtract them. For example, if you have 1/2 of a pizza and want to share it equally with your friends, you can use multiplying to figure out how much each person will get. Similarly, if you have 2/3 of a cake and want to divide it equally among three people, you can use dividing to find out how much each person will get.

In conclusion, multiplying and dividing are two essential operations that can help you solve many everyday problems quickly and efficiently. Whether you're calculating the cost of groceries, determining if you have a discount, or working with fractions, multiplying and dividing can help you get answers faster than adding and subtracting over and over.",1
"Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its influence is overstated. In my opinion, social media does indeed have a significant impact on societal norms and values, and I will provide reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook have created a virtual world where people can curate their lives and present themselves to others in a way that they want to be seen. This has led to the creation of unrealistic beauty standards, where people feel pressured to conform to certain beauty ideals. For example, the proliferation of photo editing apps and filters has made it easier for people to alter their appearance, leading to a rise in body dysmorphic disorder and low self-esteem among young people. This is particularly concerning, as it can lead to negative body image, self-harm, and even suicide.

Secondly, social media has also had a significant impact on the way we communicate and interact with each other. The rise of instant messaging and social media platforms has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, with people preferring to communicate through screens rather than in person. This can lead to a sense of isolation and loneliness, as people feel disconnected from the world around them. Furthermore, social media has also made it easier for people to bully and harass others anonymously, leading to a rise in cyberbullying and online harassment.

However, it's also important to acknowledge that social media has had some positive impacts on society. For example, it has made it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, creating online communities that transcend geographical boundaries. Social media has also been a powerful tool for social movements, allowing people to mobilize and raise awareness about important issues like climate change, racial justice, and gender equality.

In conclusion, while social media has had some positive impacts on society, its negative impacts on societal norms and values cannot be ignored. It's important for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these impacts and take steps to mitigate them. For example, social media companies can take responsibility for regulating their platforms to reduce the spread of harmful content, while individuals can take steps to limit their social media use and engage in face-to-face communication. By doing so, we can ensure that social media has a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.",1
"Hi fellow citicens! Todays we're gonna talk about why we should limit car usage. Cars are a big problem for our enviroment. They make air pollution and it's not good for our health.

First of all, let's talk about air pollution. Cars give off bad stuff like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. This stuff can cause respiratory problems, lung disease, and other health issues. It's not just bad for people, it's also bad for plants and animals.

Second, cars are a big part of climate change. They release greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere. This means that the Earth is getting warmer and warmer. It's causing problems like sea level rising, more storms, and droughts.

Third, cars are also a problem for our cities. They make traffic, which can be really annoying. It's also bad for businesses because people can't get around easy. It's also not good for our health because we're not getting enough exercise.

So, what can we do? We can start by using public transportation like buses and trains. These don't give off as much pollution as cars and they can help reduce traffic. We can also bike or walk to places instead of driving. This will help us get exercise and it's better for the enviroment.

Another thing we can do is carpool. This means that we can ride together in one car instead of everyone having their own. This will help reduce the number of cars on the road and it will also save money on gas.

Lastly, we can also use electric cars. These don't give off as much pollution as regular cars and they're better for the enviroment.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a great way to help our enviroment and our health. We can use public transportation, bike, walk, carpool, and use electric cars. Let's make a change and help our planet!

"Having a positive attitude is essential to success in life. Being responsible, amusing, and interesting are all positive qualities that go hand-in-hand with having a positive attitude. When we take responsibly for our actions and our attitudes, we show that we are contributing members of society, and people respect us for it. Being amusing and entertaining can lift others’ spirits, as well as our own, and helps us make and keep connections with others. Interesting people are often sought after for new ideas and creative approaches to life. 

A positive attitude makes us approach life with hope and a sense of determination. We’re more likely to stay energized and motivated when we have a positive attitude because we’re beaming confidence rather than negativity and apathy. This attitude can help us get through the inevitable disappointments life offers to all of us. It also helps others perceive us in a more positive way since attitudes are contagious.

Having a positive attitude can have an enormous impact on the way we experience our lives, and our success. For instance, having a positive attitude toward a job interview may result in a job offer with our dream employer. On the other hand, an applicant who enters the room with a negative attitude may unintentionally offend the interviewer or leave a negative impression. Positive attitudes can help us gain friends, be more productive, and enjoy life more fully.",1
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate around retaining or replacing the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. After reviewing arguments and information from both sides of this issue, I believe the Electoral College should be kept as it currently stands.

One argument often made in favor of changing to a popular vote is that it would make every citizen's vote truly equal and would encourage higher voter turnout nationally. However, critics point out that candidates would then solely focus campaigns on densely populated areas, ignoring many rural and less populated states. The Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and consider the interests of different regions of the country. It helps ensure that smaller states still feel represented in national elections. 

It is also argued that the Electoral College can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. While this has occurred a few times in history, it is an uncommon outcome and was the system intentionally designed by our founders. They believed that electors would ensure a candidate had sufficient support across various population centers to govern effectively. Direct nationwide elections could potentially lead to a president backed by only a narrow plurality who may struggle to build national consensus.

In conclusion, although arguments exist on both sides of this issue, I believe the Electoral College system has generally worked well for over 200 years in achieving its goals. Rather than haphazardly changing a foundational aspect of our democracy, more evidence would be needed that the current system is substantially broken before dismantling it. For these reasons, I ask that you support keeping the Electoral College as the method of electing our president. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, 

[Your name]",1
"Influencing others is a crucial aspect of daily life, whether it is in personal or professional situations. As an 8th-grade student, I have learned that there are different ways to approach the task of influencing others, and each method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast talking to someone about my experience versus talking softly and calmly about their behavior. I will also reflect on the consequences of both methods.

When it comes to talking to someone about my experience, I believe that it is important to be clear and concise. This method can be effective if the person is open to hearing what I have to say. For example, if a friend is going through a difficult time, I might share my own experiences with them to help them feel less alone. In this case, I would use a straightforward and honest approach, focusing on the facts of my experience and how it can be applied to their situation.

On the other hand, talking softly and calmly about someone's behavior can be a more subtle approach. This method can be effective if the person is not receptive to a direct approach. For example, if a classmate is consistently disrupting the class, I might approach them in a calm and collected manner, explaining how their behavior is affecting the learning environment for everyone. In this case, I would use a more indirect approach, focusing on the impact of their behavior rather than the behavior itself.

While both methods can be effective, there are consequences to consider. Talking too directly or too indirectly can come across as insensitive or dismissive. It is important to find a balance between being clear and concise while also being respectful and empathetic. Additionally, it is important to remember that not everyone will respond to the same method in the same way. It is important to be flexible and adaptable when trying to influence others.

In conclusion, influencing others is an important skill that can be developed through practice and experience. When it comes to talking to someone about my experience versus talking softly and calmly about their behavior, it is important to find a balance that is respectful and effective. By being clear and concise while also being empathetic, we can influence others in a positive way that leads to better outcomes for everyone involved.",1
" Churchill's statement about the importance of failure in the pursuit of success is a matter of debate. While some argue that failure plays a significant role in achieving success, others believe that it is only beneficial for those who truly want to change their lives. In my opinion, failure is an essential component of success, but only if it is approached with the right mindset.

Firstly, failure teaches us valuable lessons that can be applied to future endeavors. We all make mistakes in our lives, and those who are willing to learn from them are better equipped to succeed. By acknowledging our failures and taking the time to reflect on what went wrong, we can gain valuable insights that can help us avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

Secondly, failure helps to identify the true people in our lives. Those who are willing to support us during our failures are the ones who are truly committed to our success. On the other hand, those who abandon us during our darkest moments are not worth our time or energy. By recognizing the people who are willing to help us through our failures, we can focus our efforts on building strong, lasting relationships.

Finally, it is important to avoid repeating the same failure over and over again. The first time we fail, we may feel discouraged and lose our enthusiasm for success. However, if we continue to fail in the same way, we risk losing our drive altogether. To avoid this, we must be willing to try new approaches and learn from our mistakes. By embracing failure as an opportunity for growth and learning, we can ultimately achieve greater success in our lives.

In conclusion, Churchill's statement about the importance of failure in the pursuit of success is true, but only if we approach it with the right mindset. By learning from our failures, identifying the true people in our lives, and avoiding repetition, we can ultimately achieve greater success in our lives.",1
"I think that students would definitely benefit from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, distance learning provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Some students may have responsibilities at home, such as taking care of a family member or working part-time, that make it difficult for them to attend traditional classes. With distance learning, they can attend classes from home and still have time to fulfill their responsibilities. Additionally, students who live in remote areas or have mobility issues can attend classes without having to travel long distances, which can be a significant advantage.

Secondly, distance learning allows students to learn in a comfortable and familiar environment. Traditional classrooms can be intimidating, especially for shy or anxious students. By attending classes from home, students can feel more relaxed and focused, which can improve their learning experience. Furthermore, students can avoid the distractions that come with traditional classrooms, such as noise and disruptions, and have fewer distractions, which can help them stay focused.

Thirdly, distance learning can provide students with access to classes that may not be available at their local school. For example, a student living in a rural area may not have access to a particular language or advanced course that is offered in a nearby city. With distance learning, they can attend that class from home and still have the opportunity to learn from experienced teachers and interact with other students.

Finally, distance learning can help students develop important skills for the digital age. In today's world, technology is becoming increasingly important, and being able to learn and communicate remotely is an essential skill. By attending classes from home, students can develop their technical skills and become more comfortable with using technology, which can benefit them in their future careers.

In conclusion, I believe that students would benefit greatly from the option to attend classes from home through distance learning. It provides flexibility, comfort, access to a wider range of classes, and the opportunity to develop important digital skills. While there may be some drawbacks, such as the potential for technical issues, I believe that the benefits of distance learning far outweigh the drawbacks.",1
"Hey, Mr. Principal! 👋

I'm super excited to write this essay about why I think we should change the policy on students joining sports. I know you're always looking for ways to make our school the best it can be, and I think this is a super important change that could have a really positive impact on us students. 🤩

So, here's my main argument: joining sports should be optional for all students! 🏀🏈🏋️‍♀️ I know, I know, some people might think it's important for us to have a sports team, but let me tell you why I think it's better for it to be optional.

First of all, not everyone is interested in sports. Like, at all. And that's totally okay! 🙅‍♀️ Some people might not like the idea of sweating all the time, or they might not be good at it, or they might just plain not enjoy it. And that's fine! We should respect people's choices and let them decide whether or not they want to join a sports team. It's not fair to force people to do something they don't want to do, especially when there are so many other cool things we could be doing in school. 🤔

Another reason why I think this change would be awesome is that it would give us more time to focus on our studies. 📚📝 I know some people might say that sports are important for our health and fitness, but let's be real, we can get exercise in other ways too! Like, have you seen the gym at our school? It's gotta be one of the best in the district! 🏋️‍♂️ And if we don't have to join a sports team, we can use that time to work on our grades and get better at our favorite subjects. Trust me, being smart is way cooler than being good at sports. 😎

Lastly, I think this change would help us become more inclusive as a school. 🌈👥 Right now, some people might feel left out if they don't get picked for a sports team, or",1
"I have a unique artistic talent that sets me well apart from others and I should share it with the world. I have always had a gift for painting and drawing, something that has been passed down to me through generations of my family. I can create beautiful, detailed works of art on both canvas and paper, and this ability has been nurtured through my time spent in art classes and workshops. 

Painting and drawing has been a source of gratification and joy throughout my life, so I should share my gift with the world and use it as a tool to bring a little more beauty and creativity into people’s everyday lives. I believe that I can reach others with my art and inspire them to be more creative, to try their own hand at painting or drawing, or simply to appreciate the beauty that is found in art. 

In a world filled with technology and stress, it is refreshing to have the opportunity to focus on more creative passions. My artistic talent is something that I should not take for granted, and hopefully by sharing it with the world, I can help to make a positive impact.",1
"Introduction

First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that we have about someone or something when we first encounter it. These impressions are often based on our past experiences and biases, and can be influenced by factors such as appearance, behavior, and social status. While first impressions can be useful in certain situations, such as making quick decisions or forming initial judgments, they are not always accurate and can lead to misunderstandings and misjudgments. In this essay, I will argue that it is impossible to judge someone by their first impressions.

Body

First impressions are often based on superficial characteristics that do not accurately reflect a person's true character. For example, someone may be judged as outgoing and confident based on their appearance and demeanor, but in reality, they may be introverted and insecure. Similarly, someone may be judged as intelligent and successful based on their social status or occupation, but in reality, they may struggle with basic tasks or have financial difficulties. These examples demonstrate that first impressions can be misleading and do not provide a complete picture of a person's character.

Moreover, first impressions can be influenced by biases and stereotypes that can lead to unfair judgments. For instance, someone may be judged negatively based on their race, gender, or ethnicity, even if they have nothing to do with their character. These biases can also lead to assumptions about a person's abilities or intelligence, which can be detrimental to their self-esteem and opportunities.

Lastly, first impressions can be fleeting and easily forgotten, making it difficult to base important decisions or judgments on them. For example, a person may be judged as rude or unfriendly based on a brief interaction, but in reality, they may have been going through a difficult time or may have had a bad day. These fleeting impressions can lead to misunderstandings and damage relationships, as people may judge others based on their initial impressions without giving them a chance to explain themselves.

Conclusion

In conclusion, it is impossible to judge someone by their first impressions. First impressions are often based on superficial characteristics that do not accurately reflect a person's true character, can be influenced by biases and stereotypes, and can be fleeting and easily forgotten. Therefore, it is",1
"Title: The Power of Kindness: How Small Acts Can Make a Big Difference

As an 8th grader, I've learned that kindness is a powerful tool that can bring happiness to both individuals and the community. When we show kindness to others, it not only makes them feel good, but it also has a positive impact on our own life. I've experienced this firsthand, and I want to share some personal examples to illustrate the benefits of kindness.

One time, I saw an elderly woman struggling to carry her groceries on the bus. Without hesitation, I offered to help her carry her bags and even gave her my seat. She was so grateful, and it made me feel good inside. It was a small act of kindness, but it made a big difference in her day. I realized that even small acts of kindness can brighten someone's day and make them feel seen and appreciated.

Another example is when I volunteered at a local food bank. I saw how much joy it brought to the people who received the food and how it helped them feel less isolated. It made me realize that kindness doesn't have to be grand gestures, but small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.

Performing small acts of kindness can also have a positive effect on the community. When we show kindness to others, it creates a ripple effect and inspires others to do the same. It can help build a more compassionate and caring community, where people look out for each other and support each other.

In conclusion, kindness is an essential quality that can bring happiness to both individuals and the community. It's easy to overlook small acts of kindness, but they can have a profound impact on someone's life. By showing kindness to others, we can create a more positive and supportive environment, and make the world a better place. So, let's all make an effort to be kind to others, no matter how small the act may seem. It can make a big difference!",1
"As an average 8th grader, I have been researching the pros and cons of implementing a four-day school week. After conducting research and considering the effects on students, teachers, and their ability to learn and work, I have come to the conclusion that a four-day school week can be beneficial in conserving energy and resources, but it also has its drawbacks.

One of the main advantages of a four-day school week is that it can help conserve energy and resources. By cutting back on one day of school, schools can reduce their energy consumption, water usage, and waste production. This is especially important in today's world where climate change is a growing concern. Additionally, a four-day school week can also reduce the carbon footprint of schools, which can help to combat climate change.

However, there are also some disadvantages to implementing a four-day school week. One of the main concerns is the impact on student learning and teacher workload. With a shorter week, students may not have enough time to complete their assignments and projects, which can negatively impact their learning. Additionally, teachers may have a heavier workload, as they will have to prepare for and grade assignments in a shorter amount of time. This can lead to burnout and stress for both students and teachers.

There are also examples of both success and failure when it comes to implementing a four-day school week. For example, some schools have reported improved attendance and graduation rates after switching to a four-day week. However, other schools have seen a decline in student performance and teacher morale. It is important to consider these factors when deciding whether or not to implement a four-day school week.

In comparison to the five-day school week system, a four-day week can be beneficial in conserving energy and resources. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and make sure that the students are still receiving a quality education. Overall, I believe that a four-day school week can be a good option for conserving energy and resources, but it is important to carefully consider the potential impact on students and teachers before making a decision.

In conclusion, while a four-day school week can be beneficial in conserving energy and resources, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks and make sure that students",1
" Singing has always been a source of joy and relaxation for me. Whenever I'm feeling down or stressed, I turn to music to help me unwind. Singing allows me to express myself and let out all of my emotions, which can be incredibly therapeutic. Additionally, singing with friends can be a fun and social activity that brings people together.

One of the things I love most about singing is the sense of freedom it brings. When you're singing, you're not worrying about anything else, and you can just let go and enjoy the moment. This can be especially helpful when you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Singing can also be a great way to relieve stress and tension in your body.

Another benefit of singing is that it can help you connect with others on a deeper level. When you're singing with friends, you're not just sharing a song, you're sharing a part of yourself. This can be a powerful way to bond with others and build stronger relationships. Singing can also be a great way to express your emotions and connect with others who may be going through similar experiences.

In conclusion, singing is a fun and helpful activity that can bring joy and relaxation to your life. Whether you're singing alone or with friends, it's a great way to unwind and express yourself. So, if you're looking for a new hobby or way to relieve stress, consider giving singing a try!",1
" If schools offer students the option of distance learning, I believe that students should take advantage of it. If I were ever given the chance to attend an online school, I would have three reasons why I would agree with this option.

Firstly, online learning allows students to have more flexibility in their schedules. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, they would not have enough time to complete the tasks they had planned for the morning. However, with online learning, students can wake up later and still have enough time to complete their assignments.

Secondly, online learning is often more affordable than traditional schooling. In an online school, students only need a computer, notebook, and writing materials. Additionally, students can save money on transportation, school supplies, and other expenses associated with attending school in person.

Lastly, online learning can provide students with more opportunities to balance their studies with other activities. For example, students can finish their online coursework early and have more time to spend with friends, play games, or pursue other interests.

In conclusion, students should always consider the benefits of online learning when presented with the option. Online learning can provide students with greater flexibility, affordability, and balance in their lives. Therefore, I believe that online learning is a valuable option for students.",1
"Standardized testing in schools has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others disagree. In my opinion, I don't think that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability due to several reasons.

First and foremost, standardized tests only measure a narrow range of skills and knowledge. These tests usually focus on reading, writing, and math skills, but they do not evaluate other critical thinking skills, creativity, or problem-solving abilities. For instance, a student who excels in art or music might struggle in a standardized test because it does not assess their abilities in these areas.

Secondly, the pressure associated with standardized tests can significantly impact a student's performance. Many students experience high levels of stress, anxiety, and fear during these tests, which can cause them to perform poorly. Some students might also have test anxiety, which can affect their ability to demonstrate their true knowledge and skills.

Lastly, standardized tests often fail to account for differences in learning styles, cultural backgrounds, and individual circumstances. For example, a student who speaks English as a second language might struggle with a standardized test that is written in English, regardless of their intelligence or abilities.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They only assess a narrow range of skills, create high levels of stress, and overlook differences in individual circumstances. Therefore, schools should consider alternative assessment methods that better evaluate a student's knowledge, skills, and abilities.",1
"Decision-making is a crucial aspect of life, and it becomes even more important during the high school years. From choosing which classes to take to deciding which college to attend, young adults must make tough decisions that will impact their future. In this essay, I will analyze the role of decision-making in life from high school to 18 years old and provide three examples.

The first decision that many high school students must make is which classes to take. High school curriculums offer a variety of courses, and students must choose which ones will best prepare them for their future. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in science may choose to take advanced science courses, while a student who wants to become an artist may choose to take art classes. These decisions can have a significant impact on a student's future, as they may determine which colleges they are accepted into and what careers they are able to pursue.

The second decision that high school students must make is which college to attend. This decision can be incredibly challenging, as there are so many factors to consider. Students must consider the cost of tuition, the location of the school, the programs offered, and the reputation of the school. Additionally, students must also consider their own personal preferences and goals. For example, a student who values a small, liberal arts school may choose to attend a smaller college, while a student who wants to pursue a career in business may choose a larger, more prestigious school.

The third decision that young adults must make is what to do after graduation. This decision can be even more challenging than choosing which college to attend, as there are so many options available. Some young adults choose to enter the workforce immediately, while others choose to pursue further education. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in engineering may choose to attend graduate school to earn a master's degree, while a student who wants to become a teacher may choose to enter the workforce and start teaching right away.

In conclusion, decision-making plays a crucial role in life, and it becomes even more important during the high school years. From choosing which classes to take to deciding which college to attend and what to do after graduation, young adults must make tough decisions that will impact their future. By carefully considering their options and making informed decisions, young adults can set themselves up for success and achieve their goals.",1
"Title: The Importance of Vaccinations

Introduction

Vaccinations are a critical aspect of modern medicine that have been instrumental in the eradication of several deadly diseases. Despite this, there are still individuals who question the effectiveness and safety of vaccines. This essay will argue that vaccinations are essential for public health and should be mandatory for all individuals.

Body

Firstly, vaccinations have been proven to be effective in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccines have prevented the deaths of millions of people worldwide. For instance, the polio vaccine has eliminated the disease in the United States, and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of these diseases.

Secondly, vaccinations not only protect the individual who receives them but also benefit society as a whole. This is known as herd immunity. When a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, it reduces the spread of the disease, protecting those who cannot receive certain vaccines due to age, health conditions, or religious beliefs. This is particularly important for vulnerable populations such as infants, elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

Thirdly, vaccinations are safe and have undergone rigorous testing before being approved for public use. The CDC states that vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety and effectiveness before being released to the public. Additionally, the side effects of vaccines are usually mild, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, and are easily treatable.

Conclusion

In conclusion, vaccinations are crucial for public health and should be mandatory for all individuals. The evidence clearly shows that vaccines are effective in preventing the spread of infectious diseases, benefit society as a whole, and are safe. It is important that individuals take responsibility for their own health and the health of those around them by getting vaccinated.",1
"The ""Face on Mars"" is Not Alien-Made

Many people claim that the famous ""Face on Mars"" landform discovered in NASA photos is evidence of ancient alien visitation. However, closer examination shows the ""Face"" is simply a natural rock formation, not created by extraterrestrials. 

Several facts from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" support that it is a natural landform. First, the landform is made of basalt rock that is common in the Martian terrain in the area where it is located. Basalt rock is known to form into irregular cliff areas through erosion. The scale and features of the ""Face"" match basalt formations seen elsewhere on Mars. 

Second, when viewed at higher resolution by later Mars orbiters, the ""Face"" no longer looks like a structured face but rather an amorphous eroded mesa. Shadowing and lower image quality in the original photos caused facial patterns to appear that were not really there. Once that detail was revealed, the idea of it being a face created by intelligent design was debunked. 

Third, the ""Face"" shows clear signs of weathering typical of natural rock on Mars. Craters, fractures and accumulations of sediments from eons of wind and dust storms afflicting the terrain demonstrate it has been exposed on the surface for a very long time, eroding naturally into its current form. No evidence of artificial or unusually advanced technology was detected.

In conclusion, while an intriguing optical illusion, closer study proves the ""Face on Mars"" is just a oddly-shaped rock formation created through normal geological processes over vast time spans, not an artificial construct made by visiting extraterrestrials. The evidence from updated observations and analysis of its composition show it is without a doubt a natural part of the Martian landscape, not a sign of past alien visitors or intelligence. The fanciful idea it was made by intelligent design does not hold up to scientific scrutiny.",1
"The presence of cell phones in the classroom can create both positive and negative consequences for students. On the one hand, using a cell phone for educational purposes can be extremely beneficial, as students are able to more quickly access online resources such as textbooks and lesson plans. They can also use apps to help with their academic performance, by reinforcing the material they learned in class or connecting with peers and teachers to discuss difficult topics. On the other hand, students may be tempted to use their phones for non-educational purposes, such as messaging friends or surfing the Internet. This can lead to them being distracted and not paying attention to the lessons, resulting in lower grades and a decrease in productivity. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the school to set clear rules and regulations around the use of cell phones in the classroom, in order to ensure that students are able to take advantage of the positive benefits while also minimizing any potential negative consequences.",1
"Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement highlights the importance of failure as a stepping stone towards success. Failure is a natural part of life, and it can be used as an opportunity to learn and grow. In this essay, I will explore how failures can lead to success and provide examples of successful individuals who have experienced failure.

One way in which failure can lead to success is through perseverance. When faced with failure, it is important to keep pushing forward and not give up. This requires courage and determination. For example, Thomas Edison is known for his many failures, but he never gave up on his inventions. He continued to experiment and refine his designs until he finally succeeded in creating the light bulb. Edison's perseverance and determination ultimately led to his success.

Another way in which failure can lead to success is through learning. Failure can provide valuable lessons that can be used to improve future endeavors. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced many rejections from publishers before finally finding success. However, each rejection provided her with feedback and allowed her to refine her writing. Rowling's willingness to learn from her failures ultimately led to her success.

Finally, failure can lead to success through innovation. Sometimes, failure can force individuals to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative solutions to problems. For example, Steve Jobs was famously fired from Apple in 1985, but he used this failure as an opportunity to start his own company, Pixar. Under Jobs' leadership, Pixar revolutionized the animation industry with its groundbreaking films, such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo. Jobs' willingness to take risks and innovate ultimately led to his success.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's statement highlights the importance of failure as a stepping stone towards success. Failure can provide valuable lessons, encourage perseverance, and lead to innovation. Successful individuals, such as Thomas Edison, J.K. Rowling, and Steve Jobs, have all experienced failure but ultimately achieved success through their willingness to learn, persevere, and innovate. It is important for all",1
"I personally think that there should be stricter gun control laws because the safety of people is paramount. With stricter laws regarding who can own and use guns, we can reduce the rate of crimes and incidents of violence that involve firearms.

First of all, stricter gun control laws can decrease the number of gun-related deaths. According to a study conducted by the American Journal of Medicine, there is a direct correlation between gun ownership and an increased risk of homicides, suicides, and unintentional shootings. Therefore, by implementing stricter laws, we can prevent unnecessary loss of lives.

Secondly, stricter background checks before gun purchases will make it more difficult for dangerous individuals such as those with a history of mental illness, or criminals to own one. It will be an effective way to limit access to firearms by people who should not be allowed to own them.

Furthermore, stricter gun control laws do not necessarily mean that all guns will be banned. Rather, it is a way to ensure that only responsible and law-abiding citizens possess firearms. This will ensure that firearms are not used for harmful purposes, but rather for recreational and protective purposes, as intended.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are needed to keep people safe, reduce crime rates, and prevent the loss of innocent lives. Although some may argue that it violates the Second Amendment right of owning a gun, the safety of society is paramount. Therefore, I strongly support the idea of stricter gun control laws.

However, I would also like to acknowledge that stricter gun control may lead to a black market for guns, which means that criminals may still be able to obtain firearms. Nonetheless, it is an essential step in reducing gun violence and should be implemented with other measures to combat the issue of the black market.",1
"First impressions are an important aspect of our lives. They are the initial judgments we make about someone or something, based on our first encounter with them. First impressions can have a significant impact on our relationships with others, as they often shape our perceptions and attitudes towards people. In this essay, I will analyze the importance of first impressions and share my experiences and opinions to support my conclusions.

First impressions are often based on physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. These initial judgments can be influenced by factors such as age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. For example, someone who is dressed in a professional manner may be perceived as more trustworthy and reliable than someone who is dressed casually. Similarly, someone who speaks confidently and clearly may be perceived as more intelligent and competent than someone who speaks hesitantly or with a heavy accent.

Once we have formed our initial impressions of someone, these judgments can influence our behavior and interactions with them. If we have a positive first impression, we may be more likely to approach and engage with the person. On the other hand, if we have a negative first impression, we may avoid the person or dismiss them as unimportant. This can lead to missed opportunities for forming meaningful relationships and can also lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.

Personally, I have experienced the impact of first impressions on my relationships with others. In high school, I once had a classmate who I initially found intimidating due to their confident and outgoing demeanor. However, as I got to know them better, I realized that they were actually very kind and caring. If I had not initially judged them based on their first impression, I may have approached them sooner and formed a stronger friendship.

In conclusion, first impressions are an important aspect of our lives and can have a significant impact on our relationships with others. While physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice can influence our initial judgments, it is important to remember that these impressions are not always accurate. By being open to forming relationships with people based on more than just their first impression, we can miss out on valuable opportunities for connection and understanding. It is important to remember that people are complex and multifaceted, and that our judgments should be based on more than just superficial characteristics.",1

"Hey there! 

So, for this essay, I had to research different types of business management and stuff. Like, there are so many types, it's crazy!  There's traditional management, which is like, the old-fashioned way of doing things. Then there's transformational management, which is all about change and innovation. And don't even get me started on servant leadership – that's like, super important but also really hard to do. 

But, like, the thing is, managing a business is not easy.  Managers have to deal with so many pressures, like meeting deadlines, pleasing customers, and making sure everything runs smoothly. It's like, they have to be superheroes or something!  And sometimes they have to make tough decisions, like laying off people or cutting costs. 

So, to manage all that, managers have to be adaptable and flexible.  They have to be able to adjust to different business environments and situations. Like, if the market changes or something, they have to be able to pivot quickly.  It's like, they have to be able to think on their feet and make decisions fast. 

And, like, responsibility and commitment are super important for managers.  They have to be responsible for their actions and decisions, and they have to be committed to doing what's best for the business.  It's like, they have to be able to put the needs of the business before their own needs. 

In conclusion, managing a business is hard work!  But, like, if managers can be adaptable, responsible, and committed, they can handle anything that comes their way.  So, yeah, that's my essay!  Hope you liked it!",1
"Working with a group on a particular assignment can have numerous benefits, both in terms of individual learning and the overall success of the project. When students work together, they can share ideas, skills, and resources, leading to a more comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the topic.

One of the main advantages of working with a group is the diversity of perspectives and experiences. Each member brings their unique viewpoint to the table, which can lead to a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to the assignment. For example, a group of students working on a science project may have different strengths and weaknesses, such as one student being an expert in biology and another in chemistry. By working together, they can create a more complete and accurate understanding of the topic.

Another benefit of working with a group is the ability to divide tasks and responsibilities. When each member has a specific role and task, the workload is distributed more evenly, and no one person is overwhelmed with the entire project. This also helps to develop important skills such as communication, collaboration, and time management.

The group leader plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of the assignment. They are responsible for coordinating the efforts of the group, setting goals and deadlines, and mediating any conflicts that may arise. The leader should also be able to communicate effectively with each member of the group and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Working with a group can also lead to a sense of accountability and motivation. When students know that they are working towards a common goal with their peers, they are more likely to stay on track and complete the assignment. This can also lead to a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, which can be a valuable experience for building relationships and learning how to work with others.

In conclusion, working with a group on a particular assignment can have numerous benefits, including the sharing of ideas and resources, the division of tasks and responsibilities, the development of important skills, and the sense of accountability and motivation. By working together, students can create a more comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the topic and develop important skills that will serve them well in the future.",1
"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk about the pros and cons of committing to a career at a young age. Like, I know some people who are like, ""I know what I want to be when I grow up"" and stuff, but I'm still trying to figure it out. I mean, I like math and science, but I also like art and music, so... idk.

One pro of committing to a career at a young age is that you get to start building your skills and experience early on. Like, if you want to be a doctor, you gotta start studying hard and getting good grades in high school so you can get into a good college. And if you get into a good college, you can start learning more about your chosen career and getting hands-on experience. That way, by the time you're like, 25 or something, you're already a pro at what you do.

But, on the other hand, committing to a career at a young age can also be kinda limiting. Like, what if you change your mind? What if you find out that being a doctor isn't really for you, but you've already committed to it? That can be really hard to switch gears and start over. And also, you might miss out on other opportunities that come your way if you're too focused on one thing.

Another con is that you might not have as much time to explore other interests and hobbies. Like, if you're super focused on being a doctor, you might not have time to learn how to play an instrument or join a sports team. And that can be really sad, because you might miss out on some great experiences and opportunities.

So, in conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can be both good and bad. It's good because you get to start building your skills and experience early on, but it's bad because you might miss out on other opportunities and have to switch gears if you change your mind. I think it's important to have a general idea of what you want to do, but also be open to other possibilities and not be too focused on one thing. That way, you can have the best of both worlds.",1
"Honesty is a crucial value that we should all strive to uphold in our everyday lives. It's the foundation of trust and respect, and without it, our relationships and interactions with others suffer. When we are honest, we build trust and credibility with others, which is essential for any healthy relationship.

One example of the importance of honesty is in our personal relationships. When we are honest with our friends and family, they know they can rely on us and trust us. For instance, if a friend asks you if they look fat in a dress, it's better to be honest and tell them the truth, even if it might be hurtful, than to lie and damage their trust in you. In the long run, being honest will strengthen your relationship and show your friend that you truly care about them.

Another example is in the workplace. Being honest with your coworkers and superiors is crucial for building a positive work environment. When you are truthful about your accomplishments and challenges, you earn the respect of your colleagues and superiors, which can lead to better opportunities and growth. On the other hand, lying and exaggerating your accomplishments can damage your reputation and lead to disciplinary actions.

However, honesty is not always the easiest choice, especially when it's difficult or uncomfortable. For instance, if a friend asks you to lie about something to protect them, it can be tempting to go along with it. But in the end, honesty is always the best choice, even if it's hard. When we lie, we risk damaging our relationships and losing the trust of those around us.

The consequences of lying can be severe. When we lie, we risk damaging our reputation and relationships, and we may even face legal consequences. For example, if we lie under oath in a court of law, we can face perjury charges. In addition, lying can also affect our self-esteem and mental health, as we may feel guilty and anxious about keeping up the lie.

In conclusion, honesty is a vital value that we should uphold in our everyday lives. It builds trust and respect, and it's the best choice, even when it's difficult. By being honest, we can build strong relationships and a positive reputation, and",1

"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Throughout the article, the author highlights the potential benefits of exploring Venus, including the possibility of finding life and gaining a better understanding of Earth's climate. The author also acknowledges the challenges of exploring Venus, such as the extreme heat and hostile atmosphere, but argues that these challenges can be overcome with advanced technology and careful planning.

One piece of evidence that supports the author's claim is the recent discovery of a ""double vortex"" at Venus' south pole. This discovery has led scientists to speculate that Venus may have a habitable zone, where life could exist. The author notes that this discovery has ""raised hopes that future missions could discover signs of life"" (para. 7). This evidence suggests that studying Venus could lead to significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe and potentially even lead to the discovery of extraterrestrial life.

Another piece of evidence that supports the author's claim is the comparison between Venus and Earth. The author notes that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""sister planet"" due to their similar size and proximity to the sun (para. 3). However, Venus has a very different atmosphere, which has led to extreme heat and a hostile environment. By studying Venus, scientists can gain a better understanding of how Earth's climate works and how it could be affected by changes in the atmosphere. This knowledge could be crucial in the fight against climate change and could help us to protect our planet for future generations.

Despite the challenges of exploring Venus, the author argues that it is a worthwhile pursuit. The author notes that the challenges of exploring Venus are not insurmountable and that advances in technology and careful planning can make it possible to study the planet safely and effectively (para. 10).

"As technology continues to advance, it has become increasingly evident that limited human contact has had a positive impact on society in the United States. The use of technology has improved lives in numerous ways, including providing convenience for elderly individuals, offering a safe space for political discussion, providing an opportunity for less academically inclined students to learn, and fostering connections among people.

One of the most significant benefits of limited human contact through technology is the ability to provide convenience for elderly individuals. With the rise of telemedicine and remote monitoring devices, seniors can now receive medical care from the comfort of their own homes, without having to travel long distances or wait in long lines at the hospital. This has been particularly beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic, as seniors are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and are less likely to be able to receive care in a hospital setting.

Another way that technology has improved lives is by providing a safe space for political discussion. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have become popular tools for people to express their opinions and engage in political discourse. These platforms have allowed individuals to connect with like-minded individuals, share information, and have civil conversations without the fear of physical harm or harassment. This has been particularly important in recent years, as political polarization has increased and the risk of violence at political rallies and events has become more prevalent.

Technology has also provided an opportunity for less academically inclined students to learn. Online courses and educational resources have made it possible for individuals to learn at their own pace and in their own time. This has been particularly beneficial for individuals who may not have access to traditional educational resources, such as those living in rural areas or those with disabilities. Additionally, technology has made it possible for students to collaborate with their peers and teachers from around the world, providing them with a global perspective on their education.

Finally, technology has fostered connections among people. Social media platforms and messaging apps have made it possible for individuals to stay in touch with friends and family members from around the world. This has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people have been forced to isolate themselves and have been unable to travel. Additionally, technology has made it possible for individuals to connect with like-minded individuals and form new friendships, regardless of geographic location.

"Pushing oneself to reach goals in life is crucial to achieving success, even after the goal has been achieved. This is because setting and working towards goals provides individuals with a sense of purpose and direction in life. It also helps individuals develop the necessary skills and habits to achieve their desired outcomes.

One of the most successful examples of individuals pushing themselves beyond their goals is Bill Gates. Gates started Microsoft in his garage with a dream of creating a successful software company. He worked tirelessly towards this goal, and eventually, Microsoft became one of the largest and most successful companies in the world. Gates' success can be attributed to his unwavering determination to achieve his goals, even when faced with challenges and obstacles.

Another example of individuals pushing themselves beyond their goals is the Diesel Brothers. The Diesel Brothers started as a small business selling parts for their trucks, but they had a bigger vision. They worked tirelessly towards their goal of building a successful brand and expanding their business. Today, their business has grown exponentially, and they have become household names in the automotive industry.

Having the right motivation to strive for success in life is essential. When individuals are motivated to achieve their goals, they are more likely to put in the necessary effort and persevere through challenges. This motivation can come from a variety of sources, such as a desire to achieve financial success, a passion for a particular hobby or interest, or a desire to make a positive impact on the world.

On the other hand, having the wrong motivation can lead to certain failures in life. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote highlights the importance of having a unique and personal motivation for achieving success. When individuals are motivated by external factors, such as fame or fortune, they may become disconnected from their true passions and values. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in life.

In conclusion, pushing oneself to reach goals in life is crucial to achieving success, even after the goal has been achieved. Personal examples of successful individuals, such as Bill Gates and the Diesel Brothers, demonstrate the importance of unwavering determination and motivation in achieving success.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Wisdom and experience are super important things that we can learn from others. My parents, other family members, and friends have all gotten older than me, and they have a lot of knowledge and insight that they can share with me. I want to learn from them so I can be a better person and make good choices in life.

One way I can do this is by having conversations with them. When I talk to my parents or other family members, they can tell me about their experiences and what worked for them in the past. For example, my grandma has been through a lot in her life, like moving to a new country and learning a new language. She can teach me about how to be brave and adapt to new situations. My mom has also had to make hard choices in her life, like deciding which college to go to. She can teach me about how to weigh my options and make the best decision for myself.

Talking to my friends can also be really helpful. They have different experiences and perspectives than I do, and we can learn from each other. For example, my friend Sarah is really into music and has been playing the guitar for a long time. She can teach me about different chords and rhythms, and how to write my own songs. My friend Jake is really into sports and has played soccer for a long time. He can teach me about how to be a good team player and how to work hard to achieve my goals.

Listening to the wisdom and experience of others can help me grow and learn new things. When I hear about what they have gone through and how they handled it, it gives me ideas for how to handle similar situations in my own life. It also makes me feel more connected to them and more appreciative of their support.

Overall, I think it's really important to listen to the wisdom and experience of others. By doing this, I can learn new things and become a better person. I'm going to keep talking to my parents, other family members, and friends and learning from them as much as I can.",1

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in the United States or, alternatively, changing to an election by popular vote for the President. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between Congress and popular vote, has served our country well for over two centuries. While it is crucial for our democracy to evolve and adapt to the changing times, I believe the Electoral College should be preserved due to its many advantages, as explained in the texts I have studied.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certain outcome and minimizes disputes over the election results. In the 2012 election, President Obama won 61.7 percent of the electoral vote, even though his share of the popular vote was only 51.3 percent. This demonstrates that the Electoral College provides a clear winner by making a candidate's victory in each state translate into a comprehensive electoral-vote victory. The certainty of outcome offered by this system is essential for a stable transfer of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the elected President represents the interests of diverse regions. A successful president must have trans-regional appeal rather than relying solely on regional support. By requiring candidates to gain support across various states, the Electoral College fosters national unity and prevents presidents from focusing solely on policies benefiting their strongholds. This balances the interests of all regions, ensuring that no state or group of states becomes marginalized.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, ensuring that voters' voices are heard. In a nation as diverse as ours, it is crucial that candidates reach out to voters in states that might be undecided. This system guarantees that citizens in these swing states receive substantial attention, allowing them to make informed choices based on various candidates' policies and qualifications. In doing so, the Electoral College promotes an engaged and informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large and small states. In a country where population sizes vary, the Electoral College allows large states to maintain influence by allocating more electoral votes to them. This balance is crucial, as it prevents sparsely populated states from being overshadowed by densely populated states in the electoral process. By preserving this balance, the Electoral College ensures that every state remains important in electing the President.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by producing a clear winner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has prevented the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections. This efficient and decisive nature of the Electoral College system aids in the smooth functioning of our democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has stood the test of time and continues to provide numerous advantages for our democracy. It ensures a certain outcome, promotes national unity, encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, provides balance to the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These reasons, as outlined in the texts I have studied, make a strong case for retaining the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. I urge you to consider these arguments when discussing any proposals related to electoral reform.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give careful consideration to the points raised in this letter. Our democracy is dependent on thoughtful decision-making, and I hope you will support the continued use of the Electoral College system or a viable alternative.

Sincerely,

"When I first met my good friend of five years, I was immediately put off by her aggressive attitude and brash personality. I was tempted to write her off as not worth my time and leave, but I decided to give her another chance. I'm glad I did, because when I gave her a second chance to make an impression, I was relieved to find she was actually a kind and compassionate person. In that moment, I realized the importance of considering second impressions rather than relying on first impressions when meeting someone for the first time. By giving my friend a chance to make a second impression, I was able to get to know her and establish a long-lasting friendship. This experience reinforced my belief that it is important to consider second impressions even when first impressions may not be favorable.",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey Principal [Name],

I think we should have to do community service. Like, a lot of it. Like, every week. And it should be mandatory. Here's why:

First of all, it's good for us. Like, it's good for us to help other people and stuff. It's like, the right thing to do. And it's not just about helping other people, it's about learning stuff too. Like, how to work with others, how to be responsible, how to be a good citizen. Stuff like that.

And it's not just about learning stuff, it's about feeling good too. Like, when you help someone, it makes you feel good inside. It's like, a happy feeling. And it's not just about the happy feeling, it's about knowing that you're making a difference. Like, you're actually helping someone, and that's cool.

And it's not just about helping people, it's about learning new things too. Like, I learned how to volunteer at the animal shelter last year, and it was so much fun! I got to play with the dogs and cats, and it was like, so cute. And I learned how to help them find homes too. It was so cool!

And it's not just about the animals, it's about the environment too. Like, we should help clean up the park and make it look nice. And it's not just about looking nice, it's about keeping it clean so that people can enjoy it. And it's not just about enjoying it, it's about taking care of it.

So, I think we should have to do community service. Like, every week. And it should be mandatory. Because it's good for us, and it's good for the community. And it's not just about the community, it's about the world. Like, we should help make the world a better place, and community service is one way to do that.

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student!  So, I've been thinking about my future a lot lately, and I've decided that I want to play on a professional soccer team, like Barcelona!  I know, I know, it's a pretty big goal, but I'm determined to make it happen.

First things first, I know I need to work on my strength and agility.  I've been doing some research and found out that the best way to improve my strength is by doing squats, lunges, and leg press exercises.  I also need to work on my agility by doing drills like cone drills and ladder drills.  And, of course, I need to practice my ball handling skills by practicing dribbling and shooting. 

But, it's not just about me.  I want to represent my country in international matches!  I know I need to work hard and be the best player I can be, not just for myself, but for my country.  I want to bring success to my country by winning the World Cup! 

I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready for the challenge.  I'll do whatever it takes to make my dream a reality.  I'll train hard, watch my diet, and get enough sleep.  I'll do everything I can to become the best player I can be.

"In recent years, the topic of extending the school day by two hours has become increasingly contested. On the one hand, proponents of the extended day point to its potential to reduce energy consumption and resource use. The theory is that fewer buildings would be needed in order to accommodate the maximum number of students in each school district and, as a result, energy and resources would be conserved. On the other hand, opponents of the extended day suggest that there could be many potential costs and inconveniences for students, parents, and society. Longer school days could lead to burnout, exhaustion, and a lack of balance in students’ lives, and parents may struggle to fit in work and family obligations in the extended schedule. In addition, there could be costs in terms of expenses for busing, larger classrooms, and more teachers.

Having considered both sides of this argument, I believe that, while the potential benefits of an extended school day could be considerable, the risks and inconveniences to all stakeholders could be too great. Schools should consider the pros and cons of such a move carefully before implementing such a drastic change. Ultimately, it is important to acknowledge that decisions made about the school day need to be tailored to best suit the needs of the student body, the parents, and the school itself.",1
"Summer projects can be an excellent way to maintain academic progress and ensure that students are learning even while on break. However, the question is whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. In my opinion, I believe that summer projects should be a combination of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects.

Teacher-designed summer projects are advantageous because they can help students to stay on track with the school curriculum. These projects are typically well-structured and aligned with the curriculum, so it is easier for students to understand the expectations and complete the work. For example, a teacher might assign a project where students read a specific book and write a report on it. This project aligns with the school's reading and writing curriculum while also allowing students to choose a book that interests them.

On the other hand, student-designed summer projects can be more engaging and personalized to the student's interests. This type of project allows students to take ownership of their learning and pursue topics that interest them. For instance, a student might choose to research a particular topic that they are passionate about, such as climate change, and create a presentation to share with their classmates. This project encourages students to take the initiative and pursue their interests while also developing their research and communication skills.

In conclusion, I think that summer projects should be a combination of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects. This approach ensures that students are learning the necessary material while also allowing them the freedom to explore their interests. It is the best way to keep students engaged and motivated during the summer break.",1
" High school students should be allowed to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This option would provide students with more flexibility and opportunities to pursue their interests and goals.

Summer and evening classes can be challenging for some students, as they may not have the time to balance their studies with family and social activities. Allowing students to graduate in three years would give them more time to focus on their studies and prepare for college. Additionally, this option would provide students with more time to explore their interests and pursue extracurricular activities.

Elective courses during the school year should be available to all students who wish to improve their knowledge and skills. These courses can help students to develop new interests and explore different career paths. Forcing students to complete all of their required courses without the option to choose electives can be stressful and limiting.

In order to be successful in college and in their future careers, students need to be well-prepared. Graduating in three years would provide students with more time to research and apply to colleges, as well as to visit campus and gather information about different programs. This extra time would also allow students to focus on their studies and develop the skills they need to succeed in their chosen field.

Ultimately, allowing high school students to graduate in three years would benefit them in the long run. It would provide them with more flexibility and opportunities to pursue their interests and goals, while also allowing them to be better prepared for college and their future careers.",1

It's like, when you're playing pretend, but instead of just pretending to be a princess, you pretend to be a superhero too!  And it's not just for kids, either. Adults can use their imagination too, like when they're brainstorming new ideas for work or something. It helps them think outside the box and come up with cool stuff.

But, knowledge is also important. It's like, the stuff you learn in school and stuff. It's like, the facts and stuff you need to know to be smart and stuff.  And it's not just about memorizing stuff, either. It's about understanding how things work and how to apply that knowledge in real life. Like, if you know how to do math, you can use it to balance your checkbook or something. 

So, here's the thing. Imagination and knowledge are like, totally connected. Like, you can use your imagination to come up with new ideas, but then you need to use your knowledge to make those ideas a reality.  And that's when it gets really cool. When you use your imagination and knowledge together, you can create some pretty amazing stuff! 

For example, like, if you're a designer, you can use your imagination to come up with new designs for a dress, but then you need to use your knowledge of fashion to make sure it's gonna look good on people and stuff.  Or, if you're an engineer, you can use your imagination to come up with new ways to build a bridge, but then you need to use your knowledge of physics to make sure it's gonna hold up. 

And it's not just in work stuff, either. Imagination and knowledge can be used together in teamwork too. Like, if you're playing a game with your friends, you can use",1
" I believe that it is important to always strive for personal growth and development, even in the midst of challenges and difficulties. This means constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and take on new responsibilities, no matter how daunting they may seem.

For example, as students, we have the opportunity to work hard in school and push ourselves to achieve our goals. This may involve taking on additional extracurricular activities or seeking out challenging courses that push us outside of our comfort zones.

Similarly, in our personal lives, we must always be willing to take on new challenges and responsibilities, even when they may be difficult or uncomfortable. This may involve taking care of our own personal finances, or working to improve our relationships with friends and family.

It is also important to remember that personal growth and development are not just about achieving our own goals, but also about contributing to the greater good of our communities and society as a whole. This means being willing to put in the effort to help others, even if it means sacrificing our own time and resources.

In conclusion, I believe that personal growth and development are essential for leading a fulfilling and meaningful life. By constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and take on new responsibilities, we can not only improve our own lives but also contribute to the betterment of our communities and society as a whole.",1
"As an 8th-grade student, I have seen how external factors such as poverty, need, depression, relationships, and peer pressure can affect someone's behavior over time. These factors can have a significant impact on a person's mental and emotional well-being, and can lead to negative behaviors such as substance abuse, aggression, and social isolation.

Poverty is a major external factor that can affect a person's behavior. People living in poverty may experience stress, anxiety, and depression due to financial instability, lack of access to resources, and fear of not being able to provide for themselves and their families. This stress can lead to risky behaviors such as substance abuse, which can have long-term negative consequences on their health and well-being.

Need is another external factor that can affect a person's behavior. People who are struggling to meet their basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing may feel hopeless and helpless. This can lead to negative behaviors such as stealing or engaging in illegal activities to survive.

Depression is a mental health condition that can be caused by external factors such as trauma, loss, or stress. People who are depressed may experience feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and helplessness, which can lead to negative behaviors such as substance abuse, social isolation, and self-harm.

Relationships can also have a significant impact on a person's behavior. Positive relationships with family, friends, and partners can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging, which can improve a person's mental and emotional well-being. However, negative relationships such as abuse, neglect, or bullying can cause trauma, anxiety, and depression, which can lead to negative behaviors such as substance abuse, aggression, and social isolation.

Peer pressure is another external factor that can affect a person's behavior. People may feel pressure to conform to social norms or to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse or bullying in order to fit in with their peers. This can lead to negative behaviors such as substance abuse, aggression, and social isolation.

In conclusion, external factors such as poverty, need, depression, relationships, and peer pressure can have a significant impact on a person's behavior over time. These factors can lead to negative behaviors such as substance abuse, aggression, and social isolation, which can have long-term negative",1
"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, but I'm gonna give it my best shot! 😅

So, you know how sometimes you get stuck in a rut and do the same things over and over again? Like, you know, playing video games or watching the same TV shows? Yeah, it's super comfortable, but it's also really boring. And that's where exploring beyond your comfort zone comes in! 🌏

Ralph Waldo Emerson, this super smart dude, said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" 🤯 Like, he totally gets it! When you explore beyond your comfort zone, you're not just doing something new and exciting, you're also learning more about yourself. You're discovering what you're capable of, and what you're passionate about. And that's pretty cool! 😎

For example, I used to be super shy and didn't like speaking up in class. But then I joined the debate club, and now I'm like a total rockstar at speaking in front of people! 🎤 It was super uncomfortable at first, but now I love it! And I'm not alone – there are tons of other people who have explored beyond their comfort zones and discovered new things about themselves. 🌟

Like, did you know that Neil Armstrong was super scared of flying? But he still went to the moon! 🚀 And J.K. Rowling was a single mom living on welfare before she became a bestselling author! 📚 It just goes to show that you never know what you're capable of until you try. 💪

So, yeah, exploring beyond your comfort zone might be scary at first, but it's totally worth it! You never know what amazing things you might discover about yourself and the world around you. 🌈 And who knows, you might even become a superhero like Wonder Woman! 🦸‍♀️💪

Anyway, that's my essay! I hope you",1

One way that older students can help younger students is by providing guidance and support with school work. Older students can offer advice on how to approach problems, explain complex concepts, and provide feedback on assignments. This can be especially helpful for younger students who may be struggling to understand the material.

Additionally, working together in a team can benefit both older and younger students. Teamwork is a valuable skill that can help students develop communication, collaboration, and leadership abilities. By working together, older and younger students can learn from each other and share their ideas and perspectives.

It is also important for older and younger students to learn from each other and give each other valuable advice. Older students can provide guidance on important life skills, such as time management and goal setting, while younger students can offer fresh perspectives and ideas. By sharing their knowledge and experiences, older and younger students can learn from each other and grow as individuals.

Overall, schools should consider implementing programs that pair older students with younger students. These programs can provide opportunities for both groups to learn from each other, develop valuable skills, and work together effectively.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have always believed that having an older student assist in teaching a younger student has numerous benefits.

"Hey there, I know you think the Face on Mars is like, totally an alien dude, but let me tell you, it's not. I mean, it's just a natural landform, you know?

First of all, the Face is actually just a hill. Yeah, that's right, a hill. It's not some like, giant statue or anything. And it's not even a face, really. It just looks like one because of the shadows and stuff. I mean, have you seen it in person? No, you haven't. You've just seen pictures. And pictures can be, like, totally misleading, you know?

But, let's say you're still not convinced. Okay, well, according to the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Face is made out of rock and stuff. And that's just like, totally natural. I mean, rocks are like, everywhere on Mars. It's not like, some special alien material or anything. And the article even says that the Face is probably just a result of erosion or something. Like, the wind and rain and stuff just wore down the rock over time and it happened to look like a face. That's it.

And also, the article talks about how the Face is, like, not even a perfect face. It's all, like, asymmetrical and stuff. I mean, if it was made by aliens, wouldn't they have, like, made it look more realistic? Like, a real face? But it doesn't, because it's just a natural landform.

So, yeah. I'm, like, totally convinced that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. I mean, the evidence is just there, you know? It's not some, like, alien conspiracy or anything. And I know you might still want to believe it's aliens, but like, come on. Let's be real here.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens, it's just a natural landform. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" has all the evidence you need to see that it's true.So, let's all just, like, calm down and stop thinking about aliens for once. Thanks.",1
" Achieving success in life requires a set of essential elements. Successful individuals are those who have accomplished their goals and made their dreams come true. When people receive recognition for their hard work, they feel proud and motivated to take on new challenges to continue progressing in their lives. However, some individuals believe that praising a student's work is a good way to build self-esteem, but I believe that the true source of self-esteem is achievement. Praising students who do an excellent job can make them feel great, but it also helps to improve their self-esteem and encourages them to continue improving their skills and achieving more in the future.

When students receive recognition for their accomplishments, they feel proud and accomplished. This boosts their confidence and motivates them to continue working hard to achieve even more. Positive feedback from teachers and peers can create a positive environment that fosters growth and development. Students who have high self-esteem are more likely to take on new challenges and pursue their goals with determination.

Praising great students can also have a positive impact on other students in the classroom. When students see their peers being praised for their hard work, they may be inspired to work harder themselves and strive to achieve greatness. This can create a competitive and motivating environment that encourages everyone to work towards their full potential.

In conclusion, while praising a student's work can be a positive reinforcement, the true source of self-esteem is achievement. When students achieve their goals and make their dreams come true, they feel proud and accomplished, which can lead to improved self-esteem and a greater ambition to continue improving their skills and achieving more in the future. My recommendation is to encourage students to set high goals and work hard to achieve them, while also providing positive feedback and recognition for their accomplishments. This can create a positive and motivating environment that fosters growth and development.",1
"I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. it is a well-known fact that using a phone while driving can be dangerous and potentially fatal.

firstly, when drivers use their phones while driving, they become distracted, and this can lead to accidents. for instance, if a driver is texting or browsing the internet on their phone, they may fail to see a pedestrian crossing the road or a car changing lanes. this can result in a collision, causing injury or even death.

secondly, drivers who use phones while driving are likely to lose focus and concentration on the road. this may cause them to miss important road signs or signals, which can lead to accidents. it is therefore essential for drivers to avoid distractions like cell phones while operating a vehicle.

lastly, using cell phones while driving can be a major source of distraction, especially for novice drivers. these drivers are still learning how to operate a vehicle and need to concentrate on the road at all times. if they are distracted by their phones, they may fail to respond to unexpected events on the road, leading to accidents.

in conclusion, i think that drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. the risks associated with using phones while driving are simply too great, and it is better to be safe than sorry. drivers should concentrate on the road at all times and avoid distractions, including cell phones.",1
"Distance learning has been gaining traction in recent years as an alternative to traditional in-person classes for students. While distance learning certainly has its advantages, such as the ability to learn from the comfort of home and increased flexibility with time management, there are also disadvantages which inevitably come with it. One of the primary downsides is the lack of the social aspect of traditional schooling, which can lead to increased stress levels and a lack of motivation for many students. 

Fortunately, there are ways which educators can accommodate different types of learners. For instance, breaking up lectures with virtual online “room” discussions is an effective way to promote collaboration and communication between students. Furthermore, introducing more interactive elements such as small-group presentations could help reduce the stress of distance learning and help motivate students to stay committed to their courses. Overall, both distance learning and in-person classes have their share of advantages and disadvantages, and in order to find the best option for any particular student, it’s important to carefully consider the available options.",1
"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, but with a condition of using them outside of class. In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our lives, and it is only natural for students to want to have access to their phones during school hours. However, I understand the concerns of teachers and administrators who worry about the potential distractions that phones can cause in the classroom. In this essay, I will discuss how teachers can prevent students from distracting the class and the precautions students can take to avoid having their phones taken away.

One way that teachers can prevent students from distracting the class is by setting clear rules and expectations for phone use. Teachers can establish a ""no phones in class"" policy, which means that students are not allowed to use their phones during class time. This policy can be enforced by having students turn off their phones or put them in silent mode when they enter the classroom. Teachers can also use apps or software that can detect when a student's phone is on and automatically mute it.

Another way that teachers can prevent students from distracting the class is by providing alternative activities that are engaging and interactive. For example, teachers can use educational games or videos that are designed to teach students new concepts or reinforce existing knowledge. By providing students with these types of activities, teachers can help to keep students focused and engaged, and reduce the likelihood of distractions caused by phones.

Students can also take precautions to avoid having their phones taken away. For example, they can put their phones in a locked bag or case when they enter the classroom. This will prevent their phones from being easily accessible to other students or teachers, and reduce the likelihood of them being stolen or damaged. Students can also set their phones to silent mode or turn them off when they enter the classroom, to avoid any distractions.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school, but with a condition of using them outside of class. Teachers can prevent students from distracting the class by setting clear rules and expectations for phone use, providing alternative activities that are engaging and interactive, and by using apps or software that can detect when a student's phone is on and automatically mute it.

"Limiting car usage can bring about numerous advantages for both individuals and communities. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience increased happiness, improved air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable forms of transportation. The examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia highlight the positive effects of limiting car usage and exemplify the potential for change.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in overall well-being. In the town of Vauban, Germany, where cars are prohibited in most areas, 70% of families do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars in order to move there. This change has led to a decrease in stress and tension for many individuals. Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, says, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This sentiment is echoed by many others who have made the switch to a car-free lifestyle. By reducing the reliance on cars, people experience less traffic, noise, and pollution, leading to an overall improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact on the environment. Cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which have detrimental effects on the planet. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the number rises to 50%. By reducing the number of cars on the road, greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced, leading to cleaner air and a healthier environment. This is evident in Paris, where a driving ban was enforced to combat smog pollution. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in congestion and an improvement in air quality.

Limiting car usage also encourages the development of sustainable and alternative modes of transportation. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day is organized every year to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work on this day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. The success of this initiative has inspired other cities and countries to adopt similar practices. By creating infrastructure that supports walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can reduce their dependency on cars and provide residents with more accessible and environmentally friendly transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and communities. It improves overall well-being by reducing stress and tension associated with driving. It also has a positive impact on the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Additionally, it encourages the development of sustainable transportation options. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the benefits of limiting car usage and the potential for positive change in communities around the world. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and reducing our reliance on cars, we can create healthier and more sustainable communities for the future.",1
"I think schools should not let parents monitor their children's grades and attendance online. This is because students need to learn how to be independent and responsible for their actions. If parents are always checking on their child, then the student will never learn how to manage their time and take responsibility for their own learning.

For example, when I was in fourth grade, my teacher gave us a big project to work on at home. I had to do research online and write a report all by myself. It was a lot of work, but I managed to complete it and get a good grade. I felt proud of myself for doing it on my own.

However, if my parents were constantly monitoring my grades and progress online, then they might have pressured me to finish the project or helped me too much. I wouldn't have learned how to manage my time and do the work independently. That's why I think this policy is not a good thing for students.",1
"Hey, I'm totally stoked to be writing this essay! 🚨👮‍♂️

So, I've been thinking a lot about my future lately, and I've decided that I want to be a police officer when I grow up! 💪 Like, can you imagine being able to protect and serve your community every day? It's like, the ultimate goal! 🙌

I've started doing some research on careers in the police force, and let me tell you, it's like, super interesting! 🤯 Did you know that there are so many different types of police officers? Like, there's patrol officers, detectives, SWAT team members, and even K-9 officers! 🐕👀

I'm also really into criminology classes right now. I think it's so cool to learn about the psychology of criminals and how they think. It's like, mind-blowing! 🤯 Plus, it's really helpful for understanding how to catch them and keep our communities safe! 💯

Oh, and I almost forgot! 😅 I'm totally gonna write a letter to my local police department expressing my interest in visiting and learning more about their work. I think it would be so awesome to see the police in action and learn from them directly! 🤝

So, yeah, that's my essay! I'm super excited to explore this career path and see where it takes me! 🚀 Thanks for reading! 👏",1
"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of committing to a career at a young age:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about something that's really important to me, and that's picking a career when you're still super young. I think it's a good idea to figure out what you wanna do for the rest of your life when you're, like, 12 or something. Here's why:

First of all, if you know what you wanna do when you grow up, you can start working towards it right away. Like, if you wanna be a doctor, you gotta start studying hard and getting good grades in math and science. If you don't, you might not get into med school when you're older. And that would be super disappointing!

Secondly, when you're young, you're more flexible. You can try out different things and see what you like. Like, maybe you think you wanna be a scientist now, but then you realize you hate it and you wanna be an artist instead. It's way better to figure that out when you're 12 than when you're 18 and have to drop out of college to pursue your passion.

But, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what if I change my mind a lot? How will I know what I really want to do?"" And that's a valid point. But, like, I think it's better to try stuff out and see what works for you than to be stuck in a career that you hate. You can always switch to something else later if you need to.

Another thing is, when you're young, you have more time to learn new things and develop new skills. Like, if you wanna be a coder, you can start learning how to code when you're 10 and by the time you're 18, you'll be a pro! And that's way better than trying to learn how to code when you're 25 and have a bunch of other responsibilities.

Now, I know some people might be worried that if you commit to a career too young, you might",1
"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how first impressions can change based on a person's looks, personality, and communication skills. Like, I know it might seem obvious, but it's actually really important to think about how these things can shape how we perceive someone at first.

So, let's start with looks. I mean, let's be real, we all make judgments based on how someone looks, even if we don't want to admit it. Like, if someone's super attractive, we might be more likely to think they're cool and fun to hang out with, even if we don't really know them that well. But on the other hand, if someone's super awkward or unattractive, we might be more likely to write them off without giving them a chance. It's not fair, but it's just how our brains work.

But here's the thing: looks aren't everything. Like, sure, they can make a difference, but they don't define a person's personality or communication skills. And those are the things that really matter when it comes to building relationships and making connections with people. I mean, I've met people who are super attractive but also really mean or boring to talk to, and I've met people who are kind of plain but also super funny and interesting. So, it's important to look beyond the surface and get to know someone for who they really are.

And communication skills are huge too. Like, if someone can't communicate their thoughts and feelings effectively, it can be really hard to connect with them. But if someone's got great communication skills, they can make even the most mundane conversation interesting and engaging. It's like, the more you can connect with someone through conversation, the more you're gonna like them and want to spend time with them.

So, in conclusion, first impressions can definitely be changed by considering a person's looks, personality, and communication skills. It's important to look beyond the surface and get to know someone for who they really are, because those are the things that really matter in the long run. Thanks for reading, I guess!",1
"Driverless cars. Are they really the future of transportation? I don't think so. Sure, they might seem like a good idea, but let's think about it.

First of all, driverless cars are gonna take away our freedom. We won't be able to just hop in our car and go wherever we want, whenever we want. We'll have to rely on a machine to take us where we want to go. And what if it breaks down? Or what if it gets hacked? We'll be stuck.

Plus, driverless cars are gonna be so expensive. Only rich people will be able to afford them. And what about all the jobs that will be lost? Truck drivers, taxi drivers, delivery drivers, they'll all be out of work. That's not fair.

And have you thought about the safety issues? There's already been accidents with driverless cars. What if there's a glitch and the car crashes? Who's gonna be responsible? The manufacturer? The owner? It's just too risky.

I know some people think driverless cars will reduce traffic and pollution, but I don't think it's worth the risk. We need to focus on making public transportation better, not relying on machines to take us around.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not the future of transportation. They're gonna take away our freedom, cost too much, and pose safety risks. We need to focus on better, safer ways to get around.",1
"Ugh, do I really have to write another essay?  Fine.

So, should classes in the arts be mandatory or an elective in school? I think they should be mandatory. Here's why.

First of all, arts classes are super fun. Like, I know some people might think they're boring, but trust me, they're not. Painting, drawing, playing music, and stuff like that can be really enjoyable. Plus, it's not like you're gonna be stuck in there all day. You get to express yourself and be creative, which is like, really important for kids. It helps you relax and stuff.

And, um, did you know that arts classes can actually help you do better in other subjects? Like, math and science? Yeah, it's true. Research shows that kids who take arts classes tend to do better in those subjects too. It's like, they help you develop your brain or something. So, if you're not into math or science, taking an arts class can be a good way to improve your grades.

Another thing is that arts classes can help you prepare for your future. Like, if you want to be an artist or something, taking art classes can help you figure out if that's really what you want to do. And even if you don't want to be an artist, having experience in the arts can make you a more well-rounded person. It shows that you're not just a bunch of numbers and formulas, you know?

Okay, so, some people might say that arts classes are a waste of time because not everyone is going to be an artist or anything. But, like, that's not the point. The point is that it's good for you, no matter what you want to do in life. And, um, it's not like you're gonna fail if you don't take arts classes. Like, you can still be a doctor or a scientist or whatever if you don't take arts. So, it's not like it's a big deal if you don't take them.

Personally, I think arts classes are the best. I mean, I love drawing and painting and stuff. And, um, it",1
"India is a vast country with a rich history and diverse culture. The country is known for its ancient temples, stunning architecture, and vibrant traditions. In this essay, I will explore the history and culture of India, focusing on the locations mentioned in the prompt and discussing the existence of a temple made with gold in India.

India has a long and complex history that dates back thousands of years. The country has been ruled by various empires and dynasties, including the Mauryan Empire, the Gupta Empire, and the Mughal Empire. Each of these empires left a significant mark on Indian culture and architecture, with many temples and other structures still standing today.

One of the most famous temples in India is the Taj Mahal, located in Agra. This iconic mausoleum was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal and is considered one of the greatest works of architecture in the world. The Taj Mahal is made of white marble and is adorned with intricate carvings and calligraphy.

Another location mentioned in the prompt is Varanasi, a city in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Varanasi is considered the spiritual capital of India and is home to many temples and other religious sites. One of the most famous temples in Varanasi is the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, which is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The temple is made of red sandstone and is known for its stunning architecture and intricate carvings.

In addition to these temples, there are many other religious sites and structures throughout India. For example, the city of Ajanta in the state of Maharashtra is home to the Ajanta Caves, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and contain some of the finest examples of Buddhist art and architecture in the world. The caves are carved into the side of a hill and contain a variety of structures, including temples, monasteries, and stupas.

Now, let's discuss the existence of a temple made with gold in India. While there are many temples made of gold and other precious metals, there is no temple in India that is made entirely of gold. However, there are several temples that are adorned with",1
"Deer Princable,

I don't think it's a good idear to make a rule that say's we have to have a B averige to play sports or do other activites. I know you're trying to help us do beter in skool but this ain't the way to do it.

First of all, lots of us don't do so good in skool cause we have other things that are important to us. Maybe we have to work to help support our families or we're really into music or art. Just cause we ain't good at math or english don't mean we're not smart or talented in other ways.

Second, this rule would keep alot of kids from participating in sports and activites that they love. Maybe they're really good at basketball or they like being in the school play. If they can't participate cause of their grades, it would be really unfair. 

Last, this rule might make kids feel like they're not good enough. It's hard enuf to feel like you belong in skool sometimes, but if you can't do the things you want to do, it could make you feel really bad about yourself.

I think it would be better to have a different kind of system. Maybe we could have a talk with our teatchers and figure out a way to help us do beter in skool without taking away the things we love.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Working Alone vs. Working in a Group: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I've had my fair share of both individual and group projects. While working with others can be fun and exciting, I believe that working alone has more benefits than working in a group.

First of all, when you work alone, you can focus better on the task at hand. There are fewer distractions and interruptions when you're working by yourself, which means you can get more done in less time. For example, when I'm working on a science project, I can concentrate on the experiment without having to worry about what my group members are doing. This helps me to think more clearly and come up with better ideas.

Another benefit of working alone is that you can learn more about the topic. When you're working in a group, you might not have as much time to research and learn about the topic as you would if you were working alone. But when you're working alone, you can take your time to read and learn as much as you want, which can help you to understand the topic better. For instance, when I was working on a history project, I was able to spend more time reading about the topic and learning new things, which helped me to get a better grade.

Working alone can also lead to more creativity. When you're working with others, you might feel like you have to conform to their ideas and opinions. But when you're working alone, you can let your imagination run wild and come up with unique and innovative ideas. For example, when I was working on a writing project, I was able to come up with a story that was completely different from what my group members had come up with, and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the project.

Finally, working alone can help you to develop your time management skills. When you're working with others, it can be easy to get distracted and fall behind schedule. But when you're working alone, you have to be more responsible and manage your time better. For instance, when I was working on a math project, I had to make sure I finished my part on time, which helped me",1
"I believe that schools should implement policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. This practice can have numerous benefits for both parents and students.

Firstly, it helps parents stay involved in their child's education. By being able to access their child's grades and attendance records online, parents can easily track their child's progress and identify areas where they may need extra help or support. This can lead to more effective communication between parents and teachers, which can ultimately lead to better academic outcomes for the student.

Secondly, it promotes accountability and responsibility among students. Knowing that their parents are able to monitor their grades and attendance online may motivate students to work harder and attend school more regularly. This can lead to improved academic performance and better attendance rates overall.

On the other hand, some may argue that this practice can create unnecessary pressure and stress for students. If parents are constantly monitoring their child's grades and attendance, it may lead to a sense of micromanagement and a lack of trust between the parent and child. Additionally, some students may feel embarrassed or ashamed if their grades or attendance records are not up to par, which can negatively impact their self-esteem and overall well-being.

Despite these potential drawbacks, I still believe that the benefits of allowing parents to monitor their child's grades and attendance online outweigh the risks. By promoting parental involvement and accountability among students, this practice can help improve academic outcomes and foster a stronger sense of community within the school.",1
"I think our principal's idea of making us do extracurricular activies is a good one. It's important to get involved and try new things, and this way we can. Like, I've always wanted to try out for the basketball team, but I was too afraisd I wouldn't be good enough. But now that it's mandatory, I'll give it a shot! And maybe I'll suprise myself and be really good at it! Plus, it'll be fun to have a team to hang out with and stuff.

Also, some kids might not be into sports, and that's okay. There's plenty of other things they can do, like work on the yearbook or be in the school play. That way, everyone can find something they're interested in and have fun doing it. And it'll look good on our college apps too!

I know some kids might think this is a bad idea, like they don't want to do anything after school. But trust me, it's good to get out of your comfort zone and try new things. It'll help us grow as people and make new friends. And who knows, we might discover a hidden talent!

In conclusion, I think our principal made a good call with this one. It's a great way to get us involved, make new friends, and have fun. So, let's embrace it and make the most of it!",1
"Hey there!  I'm super excited to write this essay about how failure and perseverance can lead to success, just like some pretty cool people throughout history.  I mean, who doesn't love learning about successful people and how they became that way? 

So, let's dive right in! One person who totally comes to mind is Thomas Edison.  You know, the guy who invented the light bulb.  But did you know he actually failed over a thousand times before he finally got it right?  Like, what?! How did he even manage that?  But seriously, his perseverance and determination are seriously inspiring. He didn't give up, even when things got tough, and look where it got him! 

Another person who's pretty cool is J.K. Rowling.  You know, the author of Harry Potter?  She was rejected by twelve publishers before one finally picked up her book.  Can you imagine?! Twelve times!  But she didn't let that stop her. She kept going, and now she's one of the most successful authors ever! 

And let's not forget about Michael Jordan.  The basketball legend who was cut from his high school basketball team.  Can you imagine?!  But he didn't let that get him down. He kept practicing and working on his game, and now he's considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time! 

Okay, so what can we learn from these stories?  Well, for one thing, failure is totally normal.  Like, who hasn't failed at something?  But it's how we respond to failure that matters. Do we give up and give in, or do we keep going and push through?  It's all about perseverance and determination. 

And that's where Churchill's quote",1
"I think that video games can contrute to violent behavor. My reasons are:

1. Video games are like real life. When you play a game, you are the charater and you have to make descisions. If you play a game where you have to shoot people, you start to think that it's okay to hurt people. You start to think that it's okay to be mean to people.

2. Video games are a big part of my life. I play them all the time. And sometimes, I get really mad when I lose. I start to feel like I want to hurt someone. Like, I want to throw my controler across the room. Or I want to yell at my friends.

3. Video games are also really realistic. They have good graphics and sounds. They make you feel like you're really there. And that can be bad because it makes you feel like it's okay to do bad things. Like, if you're playing a game where you're a soldier, you start to think that it's okay to shoot people. You start to think that it's okay to kill people.

4. Some video games have bad role models. Like, in Grand Theft Auto, you play as a bad guy who does bad things. You steal cars, you kill people, you do drugs. And that's not okay. That's not something that we should be teaching kids.

5. Video games can also be addicting. Like, I know kids who play video games all day long. They don't go outside, they don't play with their friends. They just sit there and play video games. And that's not healthy. That's not good for their brain or their body.

So, those are my reasons why I think video games can contrute to violent behavor. I think that we should be careful about what games we let kids play. We should make sure that they're not playing games that are too violent or too mature for them. We should also make sure that kids are not playing video games too much. We should make sure that they have a balance between video games and real life.",1
" In my opinion, attending regular classes at schools is the best option for students. This is because it allows students to socialize with other people and engage in various activities outside of the classroom. Additionally, attending school provides students with the opportunity to interact with teachers and other students, which can lead to new friendships and a more engaging learning experience.

While online classes can be a good option for students who may not have access to traditional classroom settings, such as those with disabilities or those who live far away from a school, they may not offer the same level of social interaction and engagement as attending school in person. Furthermore, online classes may require students to pay for courses or classes, which can be a barrier for some students.

It is important to note that the United States has the advantage of providing free education to all students. This is a great benefit for parents who may not have the financial resources to send their children to school. However, online classes may require students to find a job to support their payments for the courses, which can be a challenge for some students.

In conclusion, while online classes may be a good option for some students, attending regular classes at schools provides students with the opportunity to socialize, engage in activities, and interact with teachers and other students. The free education provided in the United States is a great benefit for parents and students alike.",1
"Attitude is an important factor in how successful a person is in life. It can influence relationships in both a positive and negative way, impacting overall well-being. Those with a positive attitude are more likely to attract positive life experiences and decisions, while those with a negative attitude can easily find themselves in a downward spiral. The implications of attitude can be seen both personally and socially; it can shape behavior and reactions in our everyday lives.

Having good attitude can be seen as an asset—it can minimize stress, help build strong relationships, and increase productivity. It can also boost confidence, open doors, and invite opportunity into our lives. A positive attitude can shape the way we think and act, and can help us to stay optimistic when faced with difficult situations.

On the other hand, a negative attitude can bring obstacles into our lives. It can affect relationships by creating tension and misunderstanding and can even lead to isolation. A negative attitude can also be a barrier for success and can cause us to overlook potential opportunities.

Ultimately, attitude plays an essential role in how we experience life. By taking a conscious approach to how we think, changing our perceptions and developing a positive attitude, we can experience positive outcomes and greater well-being. But it is up to us to take control of our attitude and make each day count.",1
"Finishing school in three or four years has been a topic of debate among students, parents, and educators. While some argue that finishing early can lead to more opportunities, others believe that it can hinder a student's future prospects. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of finishing school in three or four years, evaluate the differences between Hispanic and American students in regards to finishing school, and make a recommendation for finishing school in three or four years.

One of the main advantages of finishing school in three or four years is that it can lead to more opportunities. Students who finish early can have a head start on their careers and can begin earning money sooner. This can be especially beneficial for students who are planning on attending college or pursuing a career that requires a lot of education or training. Additionally, finishing school early can also lead to more scholarships and financial aid opportunities, as many organizations offer incentives for students who graduate early.

However, there are also some disadvantages to finishing school in three or four years. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be more stressful for students. The pressure to graduate early can lead to increased stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact a student's mental health. Additionally, finishing school early can also limit a student's opportunities for extracurricular activities and other experiences that are important for personal growth and development.

When it comes to the differences between Hispanic and American students in regards to finishing school, there are a few key factors to consider. One of the main factors is the cultural emphasis on education in Hispanic families. Many Hispanic families place a high value on education and may encourage their children to graduate early in order to pursue higher education or career opportunities. In contrast, American families may be more focused on other aspects of their children's lives, such as sports or hobbies, and may not place as much emphasis on graduating early.

Another factor to consider is the impact of leaving school early or working full-time on a student's opportunities. For students who leave school early or work full-time, there may be limited opportunities for internships, volunteer work, or other experiences that are important for building a strong resume and networking with professionals in their field. In contrast, students who graduate on time may have more opportunities to participate in these types of experiences, which can be beneficial for their",1

"Bonjour! 

For this assignment, I researched the culture, holidays, food, and education system of France, as well as the biggest museum and famous tower in Generic_City located in France. 

First of all, let's talk about the culture of France.  France is known for its rich and vibrant culture, which is deeply rooted in its history and traditions.  The French people are known for their passion for art, literature, music, and fashion.  They also have a strong sense of joie de vivre, or the joy of living, which is reflected in their love of good food, wine, and company. 

Now, let's dive into the holidays celebrated in France.  France has a lot of exciting holidays throughout the year, like Bastille Day on July 14th, which is a big deal!  It's a day to celebrate the French Revolution and the country's independence.  And of course, there's Christmas and New Year's Eve, which are also super fun and festive times. 

Moving on to food,  Oh my gosh, the food in France is  like, so good!  From croissants and baguettes to escargots and ratatouille, French cuisine is all about using fresh, high-quality ingredients and taking the time to prepare meals with love.  And let's not forget about the cheese!  France is famous for its cheese, with over 400 different types to try! 

Now, let's talk about the education system in France.  France has a free, public education system that is highly regarded around the world.  Students attend school from the age of 6 to 18, and the curriculum includes a wide range of subjects, like math, science, language, and history. *intr",1
"The School Board's plan to add one and a half hours to the school day is a controversial issue that has sparked both positive and negative reactions from students, parents, and teachers. While some argue that the additional time will provide students with more opportunities for learning and academic success, others argue that it will negatively impact student-teacher relationships, student activities, and students' health. In this essay, I will analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of the School Board's plan and consider how it could affect different stakeholders.

One of the potential advantages of the School Board's plan is that it could provide students with more time for learning and academic success. With an additional hour and a half, students would have more time to complete assignments, review material, and ask questions. This could lead to improved grades, test scores, and overall academic performance. Additionally, the extra time could allow for more personalized instruction and support for students who may need it.

However, the addition of extra time to the school day could also have negative consequences. One potential disadvantage is that it could negatively impact student-teacher relationships. With more time in the school day, teachers may feel pressured to cover more material, which could lead to less time for building meaningful connections with their students. This could result in a more transactional relationship between teachers and students, rather than a more collaborative and supportive one.

Another potential disadvantage is that the extra time could negatively impact student activities. With more time in the school day, students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they need to complete. This could lead to a decrease in participation in extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or clubs. These activities are important for students' social and emotional development, and a decrease in participation could have long-term negative effects.

Parents may also be negatively impacted by the School Board's plan. With an additional hour and a half, students would be in school longer, which could make it more difficult for parents to pick up their children. This could lead to increased stress and anxiety for both parents and students, as they may feel separated for longer periods of time.

Finally, students' health could also be negatively impacted by the School Board's plan. With more time in the school day, students may be more likely to sit for extended periods of time, which",1
"Hey there!  So, you know how people always say ""think before you leap""? Yeah, that's totally a thing. And when it comes to choosing a career, it's super important to take that time to think about it. Like, seriously important.

First of all, let's talk about the cons of rushing into college without really knowing what you want to do.  You might end up picking a major that you're not really interested in, and then you're stuck with it for the next four years. Like, no thanks. That's like, a whole lot of time and money invested in something you don't even like. And then there's the chance that you might switch majors multiple times, which can be really confusing and frustrating. 

But, on the other hand, taking time to think about your career can be really beneficial.  For one thing, it gives you a chance to explore different fields and find out what really interests you. You can take internships, job shadowing, and volunteer work to get a feel for what you want to do. And, let's be real, it's way easier to choose a major when you know exactly what you want to do.  It's like, common sense, right?

Another pro of taking time to think about your career is that it can help you figure out your strengths and weaknesses.  Like, you might discover that you're really good at something, and you can use that to your advantage. Or, you might realize that you need to work on something specific to be successful in your chosen field. Either way, it's a win-win.

Lastly, taking time to think about your career can help you avoid burnout.  I mean, let's face it, college can be super stressful, and if you're not sure what you want to do, it can be even more overwhelming. But, if you take the time to figure out your career goals, you can approach college with more purpose and direction. And, let's be real, who doesn't want to avoid burnout? *",1
"In recent years, an increasing number of students have brought cell phones to school. This has created a debate around the issue of allowing students to use these devices during passing periods and lunch time. On the one hand, cell phones can provide convenience, lowering the cost of communication between families and providing a connection to emergency services should the need arise. On the other hand, allowing students to use their phones during passing period and lunch time can be a source of distraction, as well as a challenge to teacher authority.

From a convenience perspective, cell phones allow students to stay in touch with their families more easily and cheaply than ever before. This can provide peace of mind to both parents and students, as parents can be assured that their children are safe and that they are able to contact them quickly in the event of an emergency. In addition, cell phones can provide access to educational tools, such as instructional videos and online resources that can supplement a student's studies. 

However, allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time can lead to distractions such as playing games, texting, or social media surfing. This can interfere with learning, as it can take students’ attention away from their academics. In addition, allowing students to use cell phones can be a challenge to teacher authority, as it can be difficult for teachers to ensure that students are not using their phones during class time. 

Ultimately, a decision must be made about allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunch time. While there are clear advantages to allowing cell phones, such as convenience and possible access to educational resources, there are also risks such as distractions and challenging teachers’ authority. Therefore, these pros and cons must be weighed carefully as administrators determine the best policy for their school.",1
"Working with local companies and organizations to complete community projects can be a beneficial experience for students. It can provide students with the opportunity to gain valuable real-world experience, build their resume, and network with members of their local community. Such work typically involves tasks like conducting research, problem solving, implementing solutions, working with stakeholders, writing reports, and presenting about their findings. 

However, working with local partners can also come with potential risks. It is important that students ensure that they are aware of any safety risks and protocol that comes along with the project. There can also be a risk of miscommunication or discrepancies between the student and local partner. Furthermore, it is important to understand that working locally can involve long-term commitments which may affect the student’s ability to manage their personal and academic responsibilities. 

In addition, many students find working on local projects opens up the possibility to create long-term solutions to problems in their community. This not only benefits the student personally, but it can often lead to broader, positive effects.",1
"It is important to consider alternative extracurricular activities to the more commonly known activities such as sports, yearbook making, and student counciling. Activities such as art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer studies, science, math, reading, and writing have many benefits, such as fostering creativity, teaching valuable skills, and expanding a student’s knowledge. However, it is important to consider the drawbacks as well, such as potential distractions or lack of recognition. It is also important to understand the opinions of students who do not wish to participate in any of the extracurricular activities. Therefore, a recommendation for the principal should include a variety of extracurricular activities, including activities that can allow for creativity, such as art and music. Furthermore, there should be activities that provide an opportunity for students to learn valuable skills, such as computer studies and chess club. Finally, some extracurricular activities should allow for knowledge expansion, such as science and math. In this way, students of all interests and abilities can find an extracurricular activity that fits their needs.",1
"Failure is a crucial aspect of achieving success. It is a natural part of the learning process and helps individuals develop resilience and perseverance. Sir Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement holds true when considering the importance of failure in achieving success.

One of the primary benefits of failure is that it teaches individuals valuable lessons. By experiencing failure, individuals can identify what went wrong and learn from their mistakes. This knowledge can be used to improve future endeavors and increase the chances of success. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed 1,000 times before he successfully invented the light bulb. Each failure brought him closer to the solution, and his persistence ultimately led to a successful invention.

Another benefit of failure is that it fosters resilience. When individuals experience failure, they must learn to bounce back and continue working towards their goals. This resilience is essential for achieving long-term success. For instance, J.K. Rowling faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding a publisher for her Harry Potter series. Despite these setbacks, she continued to write and eventually achieved great success.

Churchill's statement also holds true in the context of failure. Failure is not fatal, and individuals can continue to work towards their goals even after experiencing setbacks. Churchill himself faced numerous failures throughout his political career, including the loss of the 1945 election. However, he continued to work towards his goals and eventually became Prime Minister in 1951.

In conclusion, failure is an essential aspect of achieving success. It teaches individuals valuable lessons and fosters resilience. Churchill's statement holds true, as individuals can continue to work towards their goals even after experiencing setbacks. Failure is not fatal, and it is the courage to continue that counts.",1
"""Hey, so there's a big debate going on about whether video games can actually make people more violent. I personally think that it's not really true because I've been playing games for years and I haven't felt any urge to hurt anyone. 

First of all, lots of studies have been done on this topic, but they don't always agree with each other. Some studies say that playing violent video games can lead to more aggressive behavior, while others suggest that it might actually help reduce stress and anger. So, it's hard to say for sure what the truth is.

Secondly, even if some people do become more aggressive after playing certain games, you can't blame the games themselves. It's really up to the individual and their own choices. We all have free will, right? If someone decides to act out in a harmful way, it's not because a game made them do it – they were probably already struggling with those kinds of thoughts and feelings beforehand.

Lastly, I think it's important to remember that not all video games are violent or even remotely aggressive. There are tons of educational, creative, and cooperative games out there that can actually have a positive impact on our behavior and relationships. For example, games like Minecraft encourage teamwork and problem-solving, while games like Animal Crossing promote empathy and kindness towards others.

Overall, I don't think we should be too quick to blame video games for causing violence. There are lots of factors that contribute to our behavior, and it's unfair to single out one form of entertainment as the root cause.""",1
"I think we should ban single-use plastics. They are bad for the enviroment and harmful to animals. For example, plastic bags and straws are used one time but they take hundreds of years to decompose. This means they pile up in landfills and oceans, hurting animals that eat them or get tangled in them.

Another reason is that plastic is made from fossil fuels which are finite resources. We cant keep using them forever, we need to conserve them. Banning single use plastics will force companies to find alternative materials that are sustainable and better for the planet.

Also, plastic is not biodegradable, it breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics which are eaten by small organisms and work their way up the food chain. This means that we are eating plastic without even realizing it.

Furthermore, plastic is not just harming animals, it's also affecting us, humans. We are breathing in microplastics, and it's in our water, food and even in the air. This can cause health problems like respiratory issues and cancer.

Some people may argue that single-use plastics are convenient and cheaper, but is it really worth the cost of our planet's health? We need to think about the future and the world we want to leave for our children.

In conclusion, banning single-use plastics is a small step we can take to reduce our impact on the environment and protect the planet for future generations. We need to take action now and make a change for the better.",1
"After completing research on careers related to the automotive industry, I discovered multiple paths to pursue. Mechanics, mechanics for self-driving vehicles, electricians, and jobs at companies such as Tesla and BMW all offer a wide range of opportunities. Education-wise, most positions require a technical college degree, although there are apprenticeship and internship options for those with only a high school degree. In addition, many of these positions require experience in the field and significant technical know-how. 

As part of my action plan, I will begin by exploring apprenticeship and internships options in the industry. I will also investigate other avenues for stepping into an automotive career without attending an expensive and time-consuming technical college.

"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I gotta list out the main reasons why people wanna lose weight, right?  Like, I'm not gonna lie, it's not exactly the most exciting topic, but I guess it's important. 

Okay, so the first reason why people wanna lose weight is because they wanna look better.  Like, let's be real, who doesn't wanna have a six-pack and be super toned?  It's like, the ultimate goal for a lot of people, and I get it. When you look good, you feel good, you know? And if you're carrying around a bunch of extra weight, it can be really hard to feel confident and comfortable in your own skin. So, losing weight can help you feel better about yourself and your appearance.

The second reason is because it can improve your health.  Like, obesity is a serious issue, and it can lead to all sorts of health problems, like diabetes, heart disease, and even some types of cancer.  So, if you can lose weight and get your body back to a healthy weight, it can really help reduce your risk of getting these diseases. And that's not just good for you, it's good for your whole family too. 

And the third reason is because it can increase your energy levels.  Like, when you're carrying around a lot of extra weight, it can be really hard to do stuff, like play sports or run around with your friends.  But, if you lose weight, you'll have way more energy and can do all the things you wanna do without getting tired easily.  It's like, the best feeling in the world! 

So, in conclusion, losing weight is important because it can help you look better, feel better, and have more energy.  It's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it.  And, if more people did it, we could have a healthier society overall. *exc",1

Additionally, sowing can be a therapeutic activity that promotes mental well-being and stress relief. The satisfaction of watching your plants grow and flourish can boost self-esteem and confidence, leading to a more positive outlook on life.

"Hey there!  So, ya know, I think it's pretty cool how failure can be like, super important in the path to success. Like, think about it, right? Like, all those successful people out there, they didn't get where they are today without facing some serious setbacks.

Like, take Thomas Edison, for example. He's like, the dude who invented the light bulb and stuff. But did you know that he failed like, a bunch of times before he finally got it right? He even said himself that he learned more from his failures than he did from his successes. That's like, crazy!

And it's not just him. Like, J.K. Rowling, the author of Harry Potter, she was rejected by like, every publisher she sent her book to before one finally liked it. And now she's like, a millionaire or something. 

So, like, acknowledging and processing individual failures is like, super important. It helps build confidence and strength in oneself. It's like, you learn to not be so hard on yourself when things don't go your way, and you start to see that failure as like, a stepping stone to success.

And it's not just about like, big things either. It's about the little things too. Like, if you're trying to learn a new skill or something, and you mess up a bunch of times, you're like, more likely to keep going at it until you get it right. And that's like, how you build up those little successes that can lead to bigger ones.

So, yeah, failure might seem like a bummer at the time, but it's actually like, a pretty important part of the path to success. Just gotta keep at it, you know? 

Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you liked it!  Let me know if you have any questions or anything.",1
"Having a good attitude in life is essential for success. A positive attitude helps individuals to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. This essay will analyze the benefits of having a good attitude, examine examples of people who became successful after adversities, and explore arguments about whether a positive attitude is necessary to be successful.

One of the primary benefits of having a good attitude is that it helps individuals to overcome challenges. When faced with obstacles, people with a positive attitude are more likely to find solutions and keep trying. They are less likely to give up, even when things get tough. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, faced numerous challenges throughout his life, including rejection from investors and the failure of his first company. However, he never gave up and continued to pursue his vision of creating innovative technology. As a result, Apple became one of the most successful companies in the world.

Another benefit of having a good attitude is that it makes things easier. People with a positive attitude are more likely to attract positive opportunities and relationships. They are also more likely to feel happy and fulfilled in their lives. For example, Oprah Winfrey, a media mogul and philanthropist, has faced numerous challenges throughout her life, including poverty and abuse. However, she has maintained a positive attitude and used her experiences to inspire others. As a result, she has achieved immense success and is known for her kindness and generosity.

While some may argue that a positive attitude is not necessary to be successful, there are numerous examples of people who have achieved success through their positive attitudes. For example, Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors in history, faced numerous failures before finally inventing the light bulb. However, he never gave up and continued to experiment until he found a solution. His positive attitude and determination helped him to overcome adversity and achieve success.

In conclusion, having a good attitude in life is essential for success. It helps individuals to overcome challenges, make things easier, and attract positive opportunities and relationships. Examples of successful people, such as Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, and Thomas Edison, demonstrate the importance of a positive attitude in achieving success. While some may argue that a positive attitude is not necessary, the evidence suggests that it is a crucial component of success. Therefore, it is important to cultivate a positive attitude in order to achieve our goals",1
"Working on school work alone or with a group can be beneficial. Working alone can provide a high level of concentration since you are not being distracted by others. It can also help foster independence, as it encourages the student to take responsibility for their own studies and investments in learning. On the other hand, working in a group can also provide many benefits. Groups can bring together multiple diverse perspectives and ideas that can create a richer understanding of a particular topic. Additionally, working in a group can provide social support and motivation, encouraging the student to be an active participant in the learning process. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately, successful school work can often depend on the individual student and their method of studying best.",1
"It is widely accepted that both physical and online learning in the classroom setting have their own advantages and disadvantages. Physical learning gives students the opportunity to actively engage in classroom discussions, form relationships, collaborate, and foster strong connections with their peers and teachers. On the other hand, online learning allows students to access a wider range of materials and resources and is often more convenient for students with difficulty attending traditional classes. 

When comparing the pros and cons of traditional classroom learning and distance learning, both have strengths and drawbacks. Traditional classroom learning allows for a hands-on approach and face-to-face student interaction, while distance learning allows for more independence and tailor-made learning programs. However, distance learning can also be hindered by technological issues and students may feel isolated from their peers. 

The potential difficulties faced with online or video conferencing may include difficulty connecting, slow connection speeds, difficulties using the necessary programs, and additional time needed for preparation. Solutions include planning ahead, using video conferencing tools designed for instruction, testing tools ahead of time, and scheduling regular check-ins with students. 

It is important to involve students in discussions about their experiences and views on distance learning. Invite students to share their stories and perspectives, and ask them to think of potential ways to become more focused and productive within distance learning. This give students an opportunity to gain a better understanding of how to successfully benefit from virtual learning.",1
"When I first heard about the Seagoing Cowboys program, I thought it sounded like a crazy idea. But after reading about Luke's adventures in the article, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,"" I'm convinced that it's an opportunity of a lifetime.

First of all, let me tell you that the Seagoing Cowboys program is not for the faint of heart. It's not a luxury cruise where you get to lounge around all day. It's hard work, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Luke's experiences show that it's a chance to visit unique places and have adventures that most people can only dream of.

For example, Luke got to visit the Galapagos Islands, which are home to some of the most incredible wildlife on the planet. He saw giant tortoises, marine iguanas, and even a blue-footed booby! Can you imagine being able to see those animals up close and personal? It's an experience that most people can only dream of, but through the Seagoing Cowboys program, it's a reality.

But it's not just about the places you visit. The Seagoing Cowboys program is also an opportunity to learn new skills and challenge yourself in ways you never thought possible. Luke learned how to navigate a ship, repair broken equipment, and even how to cook for a crew of 20 people! Those are skills that will serve him well for the rest of his life, no matter what career he chooses.

And let's not forget about the people you'll meet. Luke sailed with a diverse group of people from all over the world, and he made lifelong friends with many of them. He learned about different cultures and ways of life, and he gained a new perspective on the world. That's something that you can't get from a textbook or a classroom.

So if you're considering joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, I say go for it! It may be difficult at times, but the experiences and skills you gain will be worth it. Trust me, you won't regret it. As Luke said in the article, ""It was the best decision I ever made.""

"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that students should be allowed to choose their own extracurricular activities. This is because extracurricular activities are a vital part of a student's development, and students should have the freedom to pursue their interests and passions. However, there are also valid reasons why schools should control a student's involvement in these activities. In this essay, I will analyze both points of view and discuss my response.

On the one hand, allowing students to choose their own extracurricular activities has numerous benefits. Firstly, it allows students to pursue their interests and passions, which can lead to greater engagement and motivation in their studies. When students are passionate about a particular activity, they are more likely to put in the effort and time necessary to excel. Additionally, extracurricular activities provide students with opportunities to develop new skills and gain valuable experiences outside of the classroom. For example, participating in sports can help students develop teamwork and leadership skills, while volunteering can teach them the importance of community service.

On the other hand, schools should control a student's involvement in extracurricular activities to ensure that they are attending activities that align with their academic goals and interests. For example, if a student is struggling academically, schools may require them to participate in an extracurricular activity that is designed to improve their academic performance, such as tutoring or study groups. Additionally, schools may want to ensure that students are attending activities that align with their long-term career goals. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in science, schools may require them to participate in science-related extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, both points of view have valid arguments. While allowing students to choose their own extracurricular activities can lead to greater engagement and motivation, schools should control a student's involvement in these activities to ensure that they are attending activities that align with their academic goals and interests. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the student's individual needs and circumstances.",1
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! 

So, the debate about extending the school day has been going on for a while now, and I think it's really interesting. I mean, on one hand, extending the day could provide more time for learning and activities, but on the other hand, it could also be super annoying for students. 

Let's start with the potential benefits of extending the school day.  If we have more time in the day, we could have more classes, which means we could learn more stuff!  Like, imagine being able to take an extra math class or something. That would be awesome!  Plus, it could give us more time to work on projects and stuff, which could help us learn better.  And, um, it could also give us more time to hang out with our friends and stuff, which is important too. 

But,  there are also some drawbacks to extending the school day.  Like, it could be super tiring for students.  I mean, we already have a lot of work to do, and adding more time to the day could be overwhelming.  Plus, it could be hard for students who have after-school jobs or other commitments.  They might not be able to make it to school if it's too late, which could be really unfair.  And, um, it could also be expensive for the school to extend the day.  Like, they might have to hire more teachers or something, which could cost a lot of money. 

So,  I think the best way to go about it would be to strategically plan the school day.  Like, instead of having a long day every day, we could have shorter days but more focused days.  Like, we could have a day where we just focus on math, and then another day where we focus on science.  That way, we could still learn a lot without feeling",1
"Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about why graduating high school in four years is better than graduating in three years. I think it's pretty straightforward, but I'll try to make it interesting.

First of all, let's talk about why it's important to graduate high school in four years. I mean, it's not like it's a huge deal or anything, but it's still pretty cool. When you graduate in four years, you get to do stuff like go to college or get a job right away. And let's be real, who doesn't want to get out of high school and start their adult life as soon as possible? It's like, why waste an extra year of your life when you could be doing something productive?

But, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the extra year of learning? Won't I be missing out on important stuff?"" And to that, I say, not necessarily. I mean, sure, you might learn some cool stuff in that extra year, but let's be real, you're not gonna remember most of it anyway. And honestly, who needs to learn about ancient history or whatever when you could be learning about something useful like how to fix a car or how to do taxes? That stuff is way more important in the long run.

And let's not forget about the social benefits of graduating in four years. When you graduate early, you get to start college or get a job earlier, which means you get to start your adult life earlier too. And trust me, you don't want to be stuck in high school for five years. It's like, the longer you're in high school, the more time you waste. And who wants to waste time? Not me, that's for sure.

So there you have it, that's why graduating high school in four years is better than graduating in three years. It's just plain sense, man. I mean, sure, it might be a little harder to do, but it's worth it in the end. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be able to brag to your kids or grandkids about how you graduated high school in four years. That'd be pretty cool",1
"When I think of failing but still achieving success, two personal experiences come to mind. First, while preparing for the SATs, I studied hard for over four months but still achieved only mediocre scores. Yet rather than giving up, I studied more compromises and eventually scored high enough to gain admission into the college I wanted to attend. Secondly, my attempt to learn guitar was hampered by my lack of talent, and I kept failing every time I tried. But, I kept at it and eventually taught myself well enough to make basic melodies and chords. 

Winston Churchill’s quote “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts” has had an impact on my views on failure – it has made me realize that failure is just a stepping stone to success, and that it should not be feared, but embraced. Rather than being a deterrent to success, failure should be embraced as an opportunity to learn and grow.

I also recall one instance when a friend of mine quit soon after attempting something difficult. Even though I had tried to convince him that perseverance was the only way forward, he seemed to have given up. Seeing him give up so easily made me realize how important it is to be willing to take risks and keep failing until we eventually find success.

I believe the most successful people are the ones who maintain enthusiasm for success even after failure. They face failure, evaluate their mistakes and keep on striving for greater heights with a positive attitude and unceasing determination. People with this drive to never give up no matter how bleak the situation may be truly understand that failure is not an end, but a path to a greater success.",1
"The idea of students evaluating their teachers has been a topic of debate for years. Some argue that students should have the right to grade their teachers, while others are against it. In my opinion, I believe that students should have the opportunity to evaluate their teachers. In this essay, I will provide specific reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, allowing students to evaluate their teachers can provide valuable feedback to the teacher. Teachers often spend a significant amount of time planning lessons and teaching, but they may not always be aware of how their teaching style is perceived by their students. Student evaluations can give teachers an insight into what is working well in their teaching and what areas may need improvement. For example, a teacher may receive feedback that their lessons are engaging and well-structured, but they could work on giving more individual attention to students who are struggling. This feedback can help the teacher to adjust their teaching style and improve the learning experience for their students.

Secondly, student evaluations can also help to improve the overall quality of education. If teachers are aware of the areas where they need to improve, they can work on developing their skills and knowledge. This, in turn, can lead to better learning outcomes for students. Additionally, student evaluations can help to identify teachers who may be struggling and need additional support. For instance, if a teacher consistently receives poor evaluations from their students, the school can provide additional training or resources to help the teacher improve.

On the other hand, some argue that student evaluations may not be objective and can be influenced by personal biases. For example, a student may give a poor evaluation to a teacher they do not like, even if the teacher is doing a good job. While this is a valid concern, it is important to note that student evaluations should not be the sole factor in determining a teacher's effectiveness. Other measures, such as classroom observations and assessments, can also be used to evaluate a teacher's performance.

In conclusion, I believe that students should have the opportunity to evaluate their teachers. Student evaluations can provide valuable feedback to teachers, help to improve the overall quality of education, and identify teachers who may need additional support. While there may be concerns about the objectivity of student evaluations, these can be addressed by using multiple measures to evaluate a teacher's performance. Ultimately, student evaluations can be a useful tool for both teachers and students, and should be considered as a valuable component of the education system.",1
" The rise of technology has brought about significant changes in the way we interact with the world around us. While many people believe that the limitations of human contact due to the use of technology have positive effects on their lives, this is not entirely true. In fact, the use of technology has a negative impact on people's health and can lead to dependence on technology.

One of the most significant negative impacts of technology on health is the impact it has on our physical health. For example, people who spend a lot of time using electronic devices may experience eye strain, neck pain, and poor posture. Additionally, people who are constantly using technology may be at risk of developing a sedentary lifestyle, which can lead to a host of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

Another negative impact of technology is the way it can make us dependent on it. Many people have become so reliant on technology that they struggle to function without it. For example, people may use technology to communicate with others, navigate, and even educate themselves. While these uses of technology are beneficial, they can also lead to a dependence on technology that can be harmful. For example, instead of going for a walk or taking a break from technology to socialize, people may choose to communicate with others through social media or messaging apps.

Despite the negative impact of technology on our health and dependence on it, there are some benefits to the limitations of human contact due to the use of technology. For example, people who live in remote areas or have limited access to transportation may rely on technology to receive goods and services. Additionally, people who live in dangerous areas may use technology to stay safe and avoid potential harm.

In conclusion, while the limitations of human contact due to the use of technology may have some benefits, the negative impact on our health and dependence on technology are significant. It is important to be aware of these negative impacts and take steps to mitigate them. For example, taking breaks from technology, limiting screen time, and engaging in physical activity can all help to improve our health and reduce our dependence on technology.",1
"""I firmly believe that arts education should be mandatory, and not just an optional subject in the overall education. Arts education provides a well-rounded education to students and offers numerous benefits that cannot be overlooked.

Firstly, arts education helps in the development of creativity and self-expression. Through arts, students can explore their inner selves, and express their thoughts and feelings in unique ways. For instance, painting or drawing can help them to convey their emotions and ideas in the form of art. This skill is not developed in other subjects like mathematics or science.

Secondly, arts education promotes cultural understanding and appreciation. In today's diverse society, it’s essential to understand different cultures and their artistic expressions. Through learning about various forms of art from around the world, students learn about cultural diversity and develop an appreciation for different traditions and customs.

Lastly, arts education helps in improving cognitive skills. Studies have shown that music, dance, and theatre classes can improve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills in students. For example, learning a musical instrument requires a lot of practice, which in turn can help develop discipline and focus in the learner.

In summary, arts education provides a holistic learning experience that benefits students in multiple ways. It’s not just about drawing or playing an instrument; it’s about the overall development of a well-rounded individual. Therefore, it is crucial that arts education is made mandatory in schools.""",1
"Sure! Here is an essay I came up with based on the prompt:

As an 8th grader, I have always been fascinated by the world and its diverse cultures. There are so many places I would love to visit, but if I had to choose just three, they would be Tokyo, Japan, New York City, and Paris, France.

Tokyo is at the top of my list because I am obsessed with Japanese culture. I would love to try all the delicious food, like sushi and ramen, and visit the famous Tsukiji Fish Market. I've heard it's incredible to see all the different types of fish and seafood. I would also like to visit the Tokyo Tower and take in the breathtaking views of the city. I've heard it's really cool to see the city from up high.

New York City is another place I would love to visit because it's so vibrant and exciting. I would like to visit all the famous landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. I've heard the city has a great food scene, and I would love to try some of the famous pizza and bagels. I would also like to see a Broadway show and maybe even try to catch a glimpse of a celebrity.

Paris, France is the last place I would like to visit because I am fascinated by the history and culture of the city. I would love to visit the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum to see some of the most famous art in the world. I've heard the city has a romantic atmosphere, and I would love to take a boat ride down the Seine River and see the city from a different perspective.

Overall, I think visiting these three places would be an incredible experience. Each location has something unique and special to offer, and I can't wait to experience them for myself.",1
"Graduating high school early has become increasingly popular among students in recent years. While there are many advantages to this approach, there are also some potential drawbacks that students should be aware of. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the issue and argue that graduating early is ultimately the best option for most students.

One of the main advantages of graduating early is the extra time it provides for students to explore different career paths. By completing their high school education a year earlier, students have more time to research and apply to colleges and universities, as well as to gain work experience in their desired field. This extra time can also allow students to take courses that are not available to them in their regular high school curriculum, such as advanced placement or honors courses.

Additionally, graduating early can help students manage their workloads and reduce stress. High school can be a challenging time for many students, with a heavy course load and extracurricular activities. By completing their high school education a year earlier, students can take a break and focus on other areas of their lives, such as personal hobbies or travel. This can help reduce the stress and anxiety that often come with high school, and allow students to enter college or the workforce with a clearer sense of direction.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to graduating early. One of the main risks is the added stress and workload that comes with taking extra classes. Graduating early often requires students to take additional courses or take more challenging courses in order to complete their high school education in a shorter amount of time. This can be a significant challenge for some students, and may lead to burnout or academic difficulties.

Another potential drawback of graduating early is the lack of socialization opportunities. High school is a time when students are able to form close friendships and develop important social skills. By graduating early, students may miss out on these opportunities and struggle to make connections with their peers. This can be a significant disadvantage for students who value social interaction and relationships.

In conclusion, graduating high school early has both advantages and disadvantages. While it provides students with extra time to explore different career paths and manage their workloads, it also comes with added stress and workload, as well as the potential for social isolation. Ultimately, the decision to graduate early should be based on the individual needs",1
" In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to fall into the trap of being idle and unproductive. However, many people believe that being active and always doing something is the key to success. In this essay, I will argue that being active is the best mindset to have and that idle and inactivity serves a purpose only in certain situations.

Firstly, being active is the best mindset to have because it shows a lot about a person's motivation and actions. When you are always doing something, you are constantly striving to improve and achieve your goals. This mindset is especially important in the workplace, where employers expect their employees to be productive and efficient. If you are always doing something, you are showing your employer that you are capable of completing tasks and that you are committed to your work. This mindset also translates to other areas of life, such as school and personal relationships.

Secondly, idle and inactivity serves a purpose only in certain situations. For example, if you are 100% sure that you can complete a task or achieve a goal, then being idle and inactive can be a good way to conserve energy and focus. However, in most cases, being idle and inactive is a waste of time and energy. It is important to always be striving to improve and achieve your goals, even if it means being active and doing something every day.

In conclusion, being active is the best mindset to have because it shows a lot about a person's motivation and actions. Idle and inactivity serves a purpose only in certain situations and should be avoided in most cases. By always being active and striving to improve, you will see improvement in grades, work ethic, and body structure. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the gym not only shows that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.",1
"I think that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. They help create a more focused and respectful atmosphere, which can improve learning. For example, if students are allowed to wear whatever they want, some might wear clothes that are too casual or even inappropriate, which can be distracting for both students and teachers. Dress codes can also help prevent bullying based on clothing choices. When everyone dresses similarly, it reduces the chance of someone being teased for their clothes. Additionally, dress codes can promote a sense of unity and equality among students, as everyone is dressed in a similar manner.

On the other hand, some people might argue that dress codes are too restrictive and limit students' ability to express themselves. However, I believe that there are ways to create dress codes that balance individuality with a respectful and focused learning environment. For instance, schools can allow students to wear a range of colors and styles, while still maintaining a level of modesty and appropriateness.

In conclusion, I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. They can help create a positive and respectful atmosphere, reduce bullying, and promote unity and equality among students. By implementing dress codes in a way that balances individuality and respect, schools can create a more productive and positive learning environment.",1
"This summer, I had the privilege of visiting a small village in South America. Although I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of activities while there, one of the most memorable experiences was learning how to make traditional pottery. I was amazed to discover how much time, hard work and patience goes into making just one pot. I was equally astonished by the intricate designs the potters were able to create. 

The process, which involved mixing clay with water and collecting materials from the local environment, taught me the value of craftsmanship and taking pride in one’s work. It also showed me that even with so few resources, one can still create something of beauty. Observing the dedication of the potters in the village and the joy in their faces when they were able to produce a successful pot, taught me that there is pleasure in working carefully and patiently and that you don’t have to be wealthy to be content. This experience has certainly changed me and I hope to take this lesson with me wherever life takes me.",1
"Title: The Formation of Character Traits: The Role of Parents, Siblings, Friends, and School

As an 8th grader, I have always been curious about how our character traits are formed. It's like, how do we become the person we are today? Is it because of our parents, siblings, friends, or school? In this essay, I will discuss the influence of these factors on the development of our character traits.

Firstly, parents play a huge role in shaping our character traits. They are the first people we interact with, and they teach us right from wrong. They set the tone for our values and beliefs, and they are the ones who instill good habits in us. For example, if our parents are punctual, we are more likely to be punctual too. They also teach us how to handle emotions, how to communicate, and how to solve problems. My mom is really good at making me feel better when I'm sad, and my dad is great at teaching me how to be responsible.

Next, siblings are also important in shaping our character traits. They can be our best friends or our worst enemies, but either way, they have a big impact on us. They teach us how to share, how to take turns, and how to be patient. They also introduce us to new things, like sports or hobbies, and they help us develop our social skills. My sister is really good at drawing, and she taught me how to draw too. My brother is really good at playing video games, and he taught me how to play them too.

Friends are another important factor in the formation of our character traits. They are the people we spend most of our time with, and they have a big influence on how we think and behave. They teach us how to be kind, how to be loyal, and how to be honest. They also introduce us to new ideas and perspectives, and they help us develop our social skills. My best friend is really good at singing, and she taught me how to sing too. My other friend is really good at playing guitar, and he taught me how to play too.

Lastly, school plays a significant role in shaping our character traits. It's where we learn how to be responsible",1
" Teachers should not be allowed to design the students' projects because it can cause difficulties for the students in completing the assignment. If the teacher gives the students an assignment over the break, they may struggle to understand or complete it without the teacher's guidance. This is especially true if the teacher and the students are both on break, making it difficult for the students to get help.

When students are given the freedom to choose what they want to do for their project, it can make it easier for them to understand and complete the assignment. They can also do a lot of research on the topic and come up with creative ideas for their project. This can lead to a better understanding of the assignment and a higher quality project.

If the teacher gets to choose what the student does on their project, it can be challenging for the student to think creatively and come up with their own ideas. This can lead to a less interesting and less engaging project, which can ultimately result in a lower quality project.

On the other hand, if the student gets to design their own project, it can increase their creativity and interest in the assignment. They will be more invested in the project and may put more effort into it, leading to a higher quality project.

In conclusion, it is important for teachers to allow students to choose what they want to do for their project. This can lead to a better understanding of the assignment, increased creativity, and a higher quality project.",1
"Technology has revolutionized our lives in countless ways, both saving us time and effort in our everyday tasks, while also introducing new dangers and potential pitfalls. On one hand, cell phones and computers have allowed people to connect with one another in ways that were never before possible. However, this connectivity can have a dark side as well. For example, cell phones in schools can be an immense distraction to students, resulting in a lack of focus and a degraded quality of education. Even more dangerously, the use of cell phones while driving can be deadly and lead to serious accidents. 

Additionally, the pervasive use of technology can lead to a lack of social skills among its users, with a greater tendency toward solitude and less face-to-face contact with other humans. This in turn can lead to an increased susceptibility to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as well as a growing dependence on technology. In extreme cases, this reliance can lead to a virtual addiction to technology, where people come to rely on it to the exclusion of all else.

In sum, it is important to proceed with caution when discussing both the benefits and harms of technology. While it can be a powerful tool to improve our lives, it also has the potential to cause serious problems if used incorrectly.",1
"Dear Local Government,

I am writing to express my strong objections to the proposal of changing the school system from a five-day to a four-day workweek. It is my belief that this will prove to be damaging in a multitude of ways. 

Firstly, the lack of an extra day will drastically cut down the amount of time in the day for students to do their work, test their skills during extracurricular activities, and participate in other academic engagements, making it nearly impossible for them to establish a balance between leisurely activities and extracurricular activities. Furthermore, the truncated amount of time available for learning and growth will reduce the quality of education that the students witness in their respective disciplines.

A four-day school week will also cause undue stress and pressure on students, as all their lessons will be crammed into four days rather than five, making it hard for them to take a break from the workload. Additionally, with the three-day weekend, students may become lethargic and unenthusiastic in learning and developing skills, and gradually become less productive. 

This year’s final exams have shown us how the five-day school week motivates students to become more prepared for the assessments and can help them be ready for the future. Without this extra day, it is likely that student achievement will go down. 

For all these reasons, I urge you not to adopt a four-day work week and to maintain the five-day school week for better academic achievements and continuity. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1
"As an 8th grader, I believe that pairing older and younger students in programs is a great way to help both groups. While there are certainly benefits to this type of program, there are also some drawbacks that must be considered. However, in my opinion, the benefits of these programs far outweigh the drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits of these programs is the opportunity for older students to mentor younger ones. This can be a valuable experience for both groups. Older students can gain leadership skills and confidence by taking on a role of responsibility. They can also learn how to communicate effectively and how to handle difficult situations. Younger students, on the other hand, can benefit from the guidance and support of an older student. They can learn new skills and gain a different perspective on life.

Another benefit of these programs is that they can help to break down the barriers between different age groups. When older and younger students work together, they can learn to understand and appreciate each other's differences. This can help to create a more inclusive and supportive environment in the school.

However, there are also some drawbacks to these programs. One potential drawback is that older students may feel like they are being treated like babysitters. They may not feel respected or valued for their own contributions. Additionally, younger students may feel like they are being left behind or not given the same opportunities as their older peers.

Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that schools with programs that pair older and younger students can help students in many ways. For example, a school may have a program where older students mentor younger students in science. This can help to ensure that younger students are getting the support and guidance they need to succeed in this subject. Additionally, a school may have a program where younger students mentor older students in a foreign language. This can help to ensure that older students are able to learn the language and communicate effectively with their peers.

In conclusion, I believe that programs that pair older and younger students are a valuable tool for schools. While there are certainly benefits and drawbacks to these programs, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By providing opportunities for older students to mentor younger ones and by breaking down the barriers between different age groups, these programs can help to create a more inclusive and supportive environment in the school.",1
"Changes to the policy that requires students to have an A or B grade to participate in sports would have a variety of implications. The most obvious implication would be that students with lower grades would be allowed to participate in sports, which could ultimately result in an increase in student participation. However, this could have both positive and negative side effects. On the positive side, allowing lower-performing students to participate in sports could inspire them to strive for better grades in order to stay in the sport. On the other hand, allowing lower-performing students to participate could make them less inclined to put in the extra effort necessary to get an A or B grade, or to attend classes, as they may come to rely on sports as their primary source of motivation. Further, this could create an atmosphere in which the more successful students, who may have chosen to participate in sports as a reward for their hard work, would become discouraged and potentially less inclined to maintain their high grades. Consequently, all aspects of student effort, grades, and behavior should be carefully considered before instituting changes to this policy.",1
"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice for several important reasons.

First, getting different perspectives exposes you to a wider range of ideas and potential options. No single person knows everything or thinks of all possibilities, so hearing from more than one person increases the chance of learning something new that could be relevant to your decision. They may bring up factors you hadn't considered or propose alternative approaches you hadn't thought of. This can spark better, more well-rounded decision making. 

Secondly, multiple viewpoints help prevent blind spots. When we struggle with a choice, we can become narrow-minded or biased toward one option while overlooking weaknesses or downsides. Other people may see pros and cons that you have overlooked due to familiarity or emotions. Their exterior opinions force you out of your own head and bring objectivity to bear on your decision. Considerations you hadn't bothered weighing seriously may be pointed out. 

The opinions of others also provide a useful check against simple errors in logic or gaps in information. Consulting multiple trusted sources raises the likelihood that logical fallacies or inaccurate facts influencing your thinking will be caught and corrected before a flawed judgment is made. Others may know more details about certain options than you realize. Their feedback acts as a filter to avoid choices founded on incomplete data or mistaken beliefs.

Furthermore, seeking a variety of advice trains your decision making muscle. Defending your perspective to skeptical listeners requires that you scrutinize your thinking and strengthen your arguments. Questioning from other stakeholders ensures you don't get blinkered supporting only one view. Weighing dissimilar viewpoints stretches your ability to evaluate pros and cons from multiple sides. This exercise of considering alternatives and justifying your opinions to people with different priorities makes you a sharper, more conscientious decision maker in the long run.

In all these ways, obtaining advice from more than one person can help someone make a choice that is thoroughly examined from several angles, logically sound and aware of its weaknesses or limitations. The multiple perspectives prevent tunnel vision and catch flaws or gaps single opinions could miss. It leads to choices grounded in stronger critical thinking.",1
"As an 8th-grade student, I have always been curious about what subjects are taught in elementary school. I believe that understanding the different subjects taught in elementary school can help me become a better teacher in the future. To learn more about this topic, I talked to current teachers about their teaching styles and techniques for engaging students. I also researched how to make lessons interesting and engaging for elementary school students. Additionally, I talked to family members and friends about their elementary school experiences and observed students in an elementary school to see how they interact and learn.

After conducting my research, I found that there are several subjects taught in elementary school, including math, science, social studies, language arts, and physical education. Each of these subjects has its own unique approach to teaching, and teachers use different techniques to engage students. For example, in math, teachers often use visual aids and hands-on activities to help students understand abstract concepts. In science, teachers use experiments and demonstrations to teach students about the natural world. In social studies, teachers use real-world examples and role-playing activities to help students understand historical events and cultural differences. In language arts, teachers use a variety of teaching methods, including reading, writing, and speaking, to help students develop their language skills. Finally, in physical education, teachers use games and activities to help students develop their physical fitness and coordination.

In addition to the different subjects taught in elementary school, teachers also use different techniques to engage students. Some teachers use a direct instruction approach, where they provide clear instructions and examples to students, while others use a student-centered approach, where they encourage students to take an active role in their learning. Some teachers also use technology, such as interactive whiteboards and educational games, to engage students and make lessons more interactive.

To make lessons interesting and engaging for elementary school students, I believe it is important to use a variety of teaching methods and activities. For example, teachers could use games, puzzles, and other interactive activities to help students learn. They could also use real-world examples and role-playing activities to make lessons more relatable and engaging. Additionally, teachers could use technology, such as educational games and interactive whiteboards, to make lessons more interactive and engaging.

In conclusion, I believe that understanding the different subjects taught in elementary school and the techniques used by teachers to engage students can help me become a better teacher",1
"""The Role of Libraries in the Digital Age: A Necessity or a Relic?""

In today's world, where information is readily available at our fingertips, the role of libraries has come under scrutiny. Some argue that libraries have become obsolete in the digital age, while others maintain that they are more important than ever. As a student in grade 11, I firmly believe that libraries continue to play a crucial role in our society and should not be dismissed as relics of the past.

Firstly, libraries provide access to resources that may not be available online or may require payment for access. Not everyone can afford to purchase books or subscribe to academic journals, but libraries make these resources accessible to all members of the community. For instance, my local library offers free access to e-books, audiobooks, and online databases, which I frequently use for research projects and personal reading. Without this access, I would not have been able to complete my assignments effectively or explore new topics of interest.

Secondly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can gather, learn, and participate in various activities. Many libraries host events such as book clubs, author talks, and workshops on various topics ranging from technology to arts and crafts. These events foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for individuals to engage with others who share similar interests. Additionally, libraries offer quiet spaces for studying and working, which can be beneficial for those who do not have access to suitable environments at home or school.

Lastly, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy and lifelong learning. By providing access to diverse materials and resources, libraries encourage people of all ages to develop their reading skills and pursue their passions. Furthermore, librarians are knowledgeable professionals who can guide patrons in their search for information and recommend materials based on their interests and needs. This personalized assistance is invaluable, especially for those who may feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of information available online.

In conclusion, while the digital age has undoubtedly changed the way we access and consume information, libraries remain essential institutions in our society. They provide equal access to resources, serve as community hubs, and promote literacy and lifelong learning. As such, we should continue to support and invest in our libraries to ensure that they remain relevant and accessible to all members of the community.",1
"Individual character is shaped by a variety of forces beyond one's control, and this idea is reflected in the quote by John Lubbock, ""It is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich."" This notion applies to both material and immaterial wealth; while some may be born with an abundance of natural resources, it is only those who know how to properly use and appreciate all that they possess that can truly benefit from their possessions. Character is formed by the physical contexts in which a person is raised, as well as the values, morals, and beliefs that are instilled in them from society. The quote emphasizes that this underlying wealth or capital must be recognized and put to use in order to see the greatest value. In other words, we must be purposeful in our approach to whatever resources we may have. Through understanding and realizing the potential of our possessions, we can be more successful in life.",1
" Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during school hours, with certain restrictions in place. While it is important that students remain focused on their studies, there are times when they may need to use their phones for important reasons, such as contacting friends or family members who are not at school or seeking help with a problem.

One of the main reasons I support this policy is that students often have important matters to attend to outside of school, such as appointments or errands. Allowing them to use their phones during school hours can ensure that they are able to stay on top of these responsibilities and avoid any potential conflicts or disruptions.

Additionally, students may need to use their phones for emergency purposes, such as in the event of an accident or medical emergency. Allowing them to have access to their phones during school hours can provide a sense of security and peace of mind, knowing that they can quickly reach out for help if needed.

Of course, it is important that students are not allowed to use their phones during class or other times when they are expected to be focused on their studies. However, there should be a clear and consistent policy in place to ensure that students understand the rules and are held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, I believe that allowing students to use their cell phones during school hours, with appropriate restrictions, is a reasonable and necessary policy. It can help students stay on top of their responsibilities and provide a sense of security and peace of mind, while still ensuring that they remain focused on their studies when necessary.

Sincerely,

"Viideo gaems are the worst. They are turning our kids into violent freaks. I know this kid who plays Call of Duty all day and now he's all about killing and stuff. He's like a zombie, just walking around and shooting things. It's like, what's wrong with this kid? He needs to get outside and play some sports or something.

Another thing is, these gaems are so realistic, it's like you're actually there, you know? Like, you're in the game, and you're shooting people and it's like, whoa, this is crazy. It's desensitizing us to violence, you know? We're not even phased by it no more. It's like, oh, yeah, another dead body, whatever. It's messed up.

And don't even get me started on the language. It's like, these gaems are teaching us to talk all gruff and stuff. Like, ""Yo, bro, you got owned!"" and all that nonsense. It's like, what happened to proper English? We're not even speaking right no more. It's like, we're losing our language, our culture, everything.

But, like, on the other hand, gaems can be fun and stuff. Like, I love playing FIFA, it's so sick. But, like, it's not like we should be playing it all day everyday. We need to find a balance, you know? We need to play gaems, but also do other things, like sports, or reading, or whatever.

So, in conclusion, video games can contribute to violent behavior, but it's not the only thing. It's up to us to find a balance and not let gaems take over our lives. We need to be responsible and stuff. Word.",1
"Working in groups or alone can have its own set of pros and cons, and it's important to evaluate them to determine which approach is best for a project or assignment.

On one hand, working in groups can provide students with opportunities to meet new people and learn from each other. When working in a group, students can share their ideas and perspectives, and learn from their peers' strengths and weaknesses. This can lead to more creative and well-rounded solutions, as each member of the group brings their own unique perspective to the table. Additionally, working in groups can help students develop important social skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.

On the other hand, working alone can provide students with the opportunity to take ownership of their work and complete it faster. When working alone, students can focus on their own ideas and perspectives without being influenced by others. This can lead to more personalized and customized solutions, as each student can tailor their work to their own strengths and interests. Additionally, working alone can help students develop important skills such as time management and self-discipline.

However, working in groups can also lead to successful outcomes for students. When working in a group, students can divide work and complete projects faster. Each member of the group can focus on their own task, and the group can work together to ensure that everything is completed on time. Additionally, working in groups can provide students with a sense of accountability, as they are more likely to stay motivated and on track when they know they are working towards a common goal with their peers.

In conclusion, both working in groups and working alone have their own set of pros and cons. While working in groups can provide students with opportunities to meet new people and learn from each other, working alone can lead to more personalized and customized solutions. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific project or assignment, as well as the individual student's learning style and preferences.

"
The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could provide both benefits and risks that need careful consideration. On one hand, this technology may help teachers better understand how their students are responding to lessons in real time. By detecting when students appear confused, bored, or frustrated, teachers could make immediate adjustments to keep all students engaged. This could lead to better learning outcomes overall. However, there are also valid privacy and ethical concerns with continuously monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent. Constant surveillance of emotions may create an atmosphere of distrust between students and teachers. It could also desensitize students to expressing themselves freely and naturally. Before implementing such technology widely, steps would need to be taken to ensure student privacy is prioritized and their emotional data is kept confidential and only used to generally inform teaching practices, not individually profile each student. Additional safeguards around data storage and access may also need reviewing by privacy experts. While the intent of helping teachers optimize lessons is reasonable, new technologies always warrant scrutiny regarding unintended downstream effects. With the right protocols and oversight in place, FACS could potentially provide educational benefits. But more discussion is needed around developing guidelines that put student well-being first.",1
" First impressions are a crucial aspect of our interactions with others. They are the initial thoughts and feelings we have towards someone when we first meet them. While it is possible to change our opinions about someone later on, first impressions are often difficult to alter.

When we first meet someone, our minds are constantly analyzing and categorizing the person based on their appearance, behavior, and demeanor. This process happens quickly, often within seconds, and is influenced by our own biases and experiences. As a result, our first impressions can be shaped by factors such as our cultural background, our previous experiences with similar individuals, and our own personal preferences.

One of the reasons why first impressions are so difficult to change is because they are based on our initial reactions to someone. These reactions are often influenced by our subconscious thoughts and feelings, which are not always easy to control. For example, if we are introduced to someone who is very confident and outgoing, we may initially feel intimidated or uncomfortable. It can take time for our brains to process this information and adjust our perception of the person.

Despite the challenges of changing our first impressions, it is important to remember that they are not always accurate. Our initial reactions to someone can be influenced by a variety of factors, and may not necessarily reflect their true character. As we get to know someone better, our first impressions can be challenged and refined, leading to a more accurate understanding of who they are.

In conclusion, first impressions are an important aspect of our interactions with others. While they can be difficult to change, it is important to remember that they are not always accurate and that our understanding of someone can evolve over time. By being open to new experiences and perspectives, we can learn to see people in a more nuanced and accurate way.",1
"Hey, so like, I know it's pretty much impossible to escape the constant pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations, but I think it's super important that people are allowed to be themselves and live how they want to, no matter what. I mean, have you seen the latest meme trends? Everyone's supposed to be laughing at the same things and dressing in the same style, and if you don't fit in, you're basically a social outcast. It's like, come on, can't we just be ourselves and not have to worry about what other people think?

I know, I know, some people might be like, ""But what about when people's choices are harmful or hurtful to others?"" And yeah, that's definitely a thing, and we should definitely be mindful of how our actions affect others. But at the same time, I think it's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique perspective and experiences, and that we can't possibly understand or relate to everyone else's. So instead of trying to change each other, let's just accept each other for who we are and live our lives how we want to.

Like, I'm a pretty creative person, and I love expressing myself through art and music. But I know some people might be like, ""That's not cool or popular,"" and try to discourage me from doing it. But you know what? I'm going to keep doing it anyway, because it makes me happy and brings me joy. And if other people don't get it, that's okay. They don't have to understand or appreciate it, but they shouldn't try to take that away from me either.

And the same thing goes for like, sexuality and gender identity. I think it's totally cool that some people are into the whole gender binary thing, but for me, I don't feel like I fit into either category. And you know what? That's okay. I don't need to change who I am to make other people comfortable or happy. I'm just going to be myself and live my life how I want to, no matter what.

So yeah, I think it's important that people are allowed to express themselves and live how they want to",1
"Hey there!  So, I guess I'm gonna write this essay about graduating early from high school.  I know, I know, it's a big deal, right? 

Okay, so, I did some research and found out that you can actually graduate early from high school if you take extra classes and pass some exams.  That's cool, right?  But, there are pros and cons to it, and I'm gonna list them out for you. 

Pros:

flexes arm*
nerd face*
money face*

Cons:

sad face*
stressed face*
tired face*

And then there's the academic consequences of taking extra classes.  I found out that if you take too many classes, you might not have time to study and prepare for exams properly.  This can lead to lower grades and academic performance. 

Oh, and did I mention that extended school hours and summer school requirements can also affect your mental health and academic performance?  It's like, if you have to stay in school for longer hours, you might feel more stressed and exhausted, which can affect your grades and overall well-being. 

So, now I'm gonna compare four years of high school vs. graduating early.  I think it's like, if you do four years of high school, you have more time to explore your interests and passions, and you can take more classes that are fun and challenging",1
"Dear Principal,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the idea of students performing community service.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because it is a great way to give back to our community and help others. It also teaches us the value of hard work and responsibility.

Some of my friends already perform community service by tutoring younger children or cleaning up litter. They have told me how fulfilling it is to know that they are making a difference in their community. They have also learned valuable skills such as patience, communication, and problem-solving.

On the other hand, some of my friends do not believe in community service because they think it takes away from their own personal time. However, I disagree with this. Community service is a chance for us to take a break from our own lives and focus on the needs of others. It can also be a fun and rewarding experience, especially when we do it together as a group.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should be required to perform community service. It is a great way to give back to our community, teach us valuable skills, and help us become responsible citizens. I hope you will consider my thoughts and make community service a requirement for all students.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

"I strongly believe that the Electoral College should remain the way it is or, better yet, that we should elect the president by popular vote. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College does not accurately reflect the will of the people. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, an estimated two million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump however, Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304 to 232. This means that a candidate can win a majority of the Electoral College voters while losing the popular vote! Furthermore, voting for President should be an individual citizen decision, not a state decision. The Electoral College works by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the winner of the majority of votes in the state. This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not receive any of that states electoral votes. This goes against the concept of onepersononevote, since a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not win any electoral votes. By eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote, the votes of every individual will be counted, and the candidate who wins the most votes nationally will win the election. In conclusion, the Electoral College does not reflect the will of the people and votes in state are not equally weighted. It is time to elect the president by popular vote and to finally give the votes of individual citizens the weight they deserve.",1
" A positive outlook is essential to achieving success in life.

Can you imagine the world without positivity? Some individuals have achieved great success through a positive attitude, while others struggle to keep up. I believe that positivity is crucial because it leads to a healthy mindset, good relationships, and successful accomplishments.

Firstly, success is not limited to a select few. We are all human beings with our own strengths, weaknesses, and emotions. Often, our weaknesses can be our greatest strengths and provide valuable lessons that lead to success. Life is like a school, with lessons, tests, and grades. However, our attitude determines who we become, and a positive outlook is essential to achieving our goals.

Secondly, ""being positive"" means being patient. For instance, the person who always compliments me is my mother. I know about her experiences in her job, and she faced difficult times, but her positive attitude has helped her achieve success in her career. I remember when she had strict bosses, unsupportive friends, and financial struggles. My parents taught me that no matter where we are, it's important to be mature, show respect, contribute positively to our community, and be kind. This has helped me become a successful individual.

On the other hand, some people argue that the world is too difficult, and success cannot be achieved through positivity alone. They believe that other factors such as money, a good community, and education are necessary for success. While these factors are important, thinking positively and having the determination to achieve our goals is already a form of success. Success is not only about being rich and famous; it's about following our dreams, helping others, and motivating them to be positive.

Finally, to be successful in life, we must maintain a positive outlook in difficult situations. I find humor in challenging times and try to see the bright side of things. I am responsible for my life, and I choose positivity to achieve my goals and make a positive impact on my community. This approach has helped me become a successful individual and has brought me immense joy and fulfillment.",1
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact both individuals and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, and this movement, known as ""smart planning"", has shown great potential in improving overall quality of life and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, communities can become more compact, accessible, and environmentally friendly.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a huge impediment to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of overall air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been enforced to clear the air. During these bans, congestion has decreased significantly and the levels of smog have reduced. This not only improves the health and well-being of the residents but also creates a more pleasant and livable environment. By limiting car usage, cities can combat air pollution and create cleaner and healthier spaces for their inhabitants.

Limiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. This has created a more relaxed and stress-free atmosphere, as residents no longer have to worry about the hassles of car ownership and the constant traffic congestion. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more compact communities with walkable streets and accessible public transportation. Stores are placed closer to residential areas, making it more convenient for people to access essential services without having to rely on cars. This can have a positive impact on local businesses and economies.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities, limiting car usage can help combat climate change, promote healthier living, and create more vibrant and livable spaces. It is an essential step towards creating a sustainable future.",1
"Okay, here's my essay:

Competition in the workplace can be a great thing. It makes us work harder and be better. When we're competing with our coworkers, we want to do a good job so we can be the best. It's like a race to see who can do the most work or make the most money. It makes us want to work harder and be better.

But sometimes competition can be bad too. When it's too much, it can make people stressed out and not want to work at all. It's like, why bother if someone else is going to get the promotion? Or why work hard if someone else is going to take all the credit? That can make people not like coming to work and not want to do their best.

But overall, competition in the workplace can be good. It makes us work harder and be better. It's like a challenge, and we want to see if we can do it. It makes us feel good when we do a good job and see that we're better than someone else. It's like, yessss, I did it!

I think that competition in the workplace is important because it makes us want to do our best. It's like a game, and we want to win. When we're competing, we're not thinking about how hard it is or how tired we are. We're just thinking about how we can do better than the other person. It makes us focus and be more productive.

So, in conclusion, competition in the workplace can be good or bad, depending on how much there is. But overall, it makes us work harder and be better. It's like a challenge, and we want to see if we can do it. And when we do, it feels great!",1
"Libraries have been a vital part of our society for centuries, providing access to knowledge and information for people of all ages. However, with the advent of the digital age, some people argue that libraries are no longer necessary. In this essay, I will argue for the continued importance of libraries, highlighting their unique role in the digital age.

Firstly, libraries provide a free and accessible source of information. With the rise of the internet, it's true that we can access a vast amount of information online. However, not everyone has access to the internet, and even those who do may not be able to discern what information is reliable and trustworthy. Libraries provide a curated collection of books, journals, and other resources that are carefully selected and organized, making it easier for people to find accurate and relevant information. Additionally, libraries often offer free access to digital resources, such as online databases and e-books, which can be accessed by anyone with a library card.

Secondly, libraries are a vital resource for students. In today's digital age, students are often required to do extensive research for their school projects. Libraries provide a quiet and focused environment for students to work on their projects, with access to a wide range of resources that they may not have at home. Librarians are also trained to help students develop their research skills, providing guidance on how to evaluate sources and cite references properly.

Thirdly, libraries are an important community hub. They provide a safe and welcoming space for people of all ages to come together, learn, and engage with each other. Libraries often host events and programs for children, such as storytime and book clubs, which help to foster a love of reading and learning from an early age. They also offer resources and services for seniors, such as book delivery and technology classes, which help to support their well-being and independence.

Finally, libraries are essential for promoting literacy and lifelong learning. In today's fast-paced digital world, it's easy to get caught up in the latest news and social media trends. Libraries provide a respite from the constant barrage of information, offering a chance to slow down and engage with the world around us. They promote literacy by providing access to books and other resources that help people develop their reading and writing skills, and they offer classes and workshops that help people learn new skills and expand their knowledge.

In conclusion, libraries continue to play a vital role in the digital age. They provide free and accessible information, support students, serve as a community hub, and promote literacy and lifelong learning. While the digital age has certainly changed the way we access information, it has not made libraries obsolete. In fact, libraries are more important than ever, providing a safe and welcoming space for people to come together and engage with the world around us.",1
"Hey there! 

So, you know how people always say that small acts of kindness can go a long way?  Like, they're not just saying that, you know? It's actually true! 

I mean, think about it. When someone holds the door open for you, or gives you a compliment, or even just smiles at you, it's like, wow, that made my day!  And it's not just the person receiving the kindness, it's like, it spreads! 

Like, research shows that when we do small acts of kindness, it releases endorphins in our brains, which are like, the happy hormones!  And that's why we feel so good when we help someone else out! 

But it's not just about the feel-good factor, you know?  Small acts of kindness can actually create opportunities in people's lives!  Like, when we volunteer or help someone in need, it can lead to new connections and experiences! 

And it's not just about the big things either!  Like, when we hold the door open for someone, or give them a compliment, it might seem like a small thing, but it can make their day!  And when we make someone's day, it can snowball into something bigger! 

Parents play a huge role in teaching kindness and fostering its presence in communities!  They're like, the ones who teach us to be empathetic and compassionate towards others!  And when we grow up with those values, we're more likely to carry them into adulthood! 

So, the next time you're thinking about doing something nice for someone, just do it!  It might seem like a small act of kindness, but it could make a huge difference in someone's life!  And who knows, it might even create",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I have observed that most students do not like the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. There are several reasons why this is the case, and these reasons have a significant impact on the performance of students in school. In this essay, I will analyze these reasons and suggest solutions that would make the school cafeteria more appetizing and appealing to students while taking into account the concerns of parents.

One of the primary reasons why students do not like the school lunch is because of the lack of variety in the menu. The same options are served day after day, which can become monotonous and unappetizing. This lack of variety can lead to students skipping meals or eating unhealthy snacks, which can negatively impact their academic performance. To address this issue, the school could introduce a rotating menu that includes a variety of options, such as salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes. This would give students more options to choose from and prevent them from getting bored with the same old menu.

Another reason why students do not like the school lunch is because of the quality of the food. Many students have reported that the food served in the cafeteria is often cold, dry, and lacks flavor. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as inadequate cooking equipment, overcrowding, and a lack of staff training. To address this issue, the school could invest in better cooking equipment, hire more staff to prepare the food, and provide training to ensure that the food is cooked to the appropriate temperature and served promptly.

Lastly, students do not like the school lunch because of the cost. Many students come from low-income families and cannot afford to pay for additional meals or snacks. This can lead to students going hungry or eating unhealthy foods, which can negatively impact their academic performance. To address this issue, the school could offer free or reduced-price meals to students from low-income families. Additionally, the school could partner with local businesses to provide discounts or coupons for students to use at the cafeteria.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why most students do not like the school lunch offered in the cafeteria. These reasons include a lack of variety in the menu, the quality of the food, and the cost. To address these issues, the school could",1

"Title: The Implications of Implementing a Four-Day School Week

Introduction

The traditional five-day school week has been a staple of the educational system for decades. However, with the advent of technology and the changing nature of work, many schools are considering implementing a four-day school week. This essay will explore the implications of implementing a four-day school week from a student, parent, and administration point of view.

Pros of a Four-Day School Week

One of the main advantages of a four-day school week is that it can help students achieve a better work-life balance. With fewer days in school, students can have more time to pursue extracurricular activities, spend time with family and friends, and engage in hobbies. This can lead to increased overall happiness and well-being among students.

Another advantage is that a four-day school week can help reduce stress levels. Students often experience stress from homework, exams, and other academic pressures. By having an extra day off each week, students can have more time to catch up on work and reduce their stress levels.

Cons of a Four-Day School Week

One of the main disadvantages of a four-day school week is that it can disrupt the traditional school schedule. Many students and parents are used to the five-day school week, and a four-day school week could cause confusion and disruption.

Another disadvantage is that a four-day school week could lead to a decrease in academic performance. With fewer days in school, students may not have enough time to complete all of their work, which could lead to lower grades and a decrease in overall academic achievement.

Practicality from a Student, Parent, and Administration Point of View

From a student point of view, a four-day school week could be beneficial as it would allow for more time to pursue extracurricular activities and hobbies. However, students may also feel overwhelmed with the workload and struggle to keep up with their academic responsibilities.

From a parent's point of view, a four-day school week could provide more time for families to spend together and engage in activities outside of school. However, parents may also worry about their children falling behind academically and struggle to find childcare on the extra day off.

From an administrative point",1
" The use of cell phones in the classroom has become a controversial topic in recent years. While some argue that cell phones can be a useful tool for students, others believe that they can be a distraction and detract from the learning experience. In this essay, I will argue that the use of cell phones in the classroom should be limited and only used for educational purposes.

One of the main advantages of using cell phones in the classroom is that they can be a valuable resource for students. Cell phones are equipped with powerful search engines and can be used to quickly find information on a variety of topics. This can be particularly useful for students who are struggling with a particular concept or topic, as they can quickly find additional resources to help them understand the material.

In addition to being a useful resource, cell phones can also be used to enhance the learning experience. For example, teachers can use cell phones to create interactive lessons and activities that engage students and encourage them to think critically. Cell phones can also be used to collaborate with other students and teachers, allowing for real-time communication and feedback.

However, there are also many potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. One of the main concerns is that cell phones can be a distraction and detract from the learning experience. If students are constantly checking their phones or scrolling through social media, they are not focusing on the material at hand. This can lead to a lack of engagement and a reduced understanding of the material.

Another concern is that cell phones can be a source of cheating. With the internet at their fingertips, students can easily access answers and cheat on exams and assignments. This not only undermines the integrity of the educational process, but it also fails to prepare students for real-world situations where they will need to think critically and independently.

In conclusion, while cell phones can be a useful tool for students, their use in the classroom should be limited and only used for educational purposes. Teachers should create an environment that encourages students to focus on the material at hand and ignores the distractions of social media and other apps. By doing so, we can ensure that students are receiving the best possible education and are prepared for success in the real world.",1
"Hey there!  So, I guess I'm gonna write this essay about the effects of technology on humans.  Like, it's a pretty big topic, right? I mean, technology is everywhere these days. We've got smartphones, laptops, tablets, you name it. It's like, how did we even survive without them? 

Okay, so, let's start with the positive effects of technology.  I mean, technology has made our lives so much easier, you know? Like, we can communicate with people all over the world with just a few taps on our phones. It's like, mind-blowing! And with all the online learning resources, we can learn new things and expand our knowledge without even leaving our homes. That's pretty cool, right? 

But,  there are also some negative effects of technology.  Like, for one thing, we're all becoming super addicted to our devices. It's like, we can't put them down for more than a few minutes without getting withdrawal symptoms.  And it's not just us, our parents and grandparents are addicted too!  It's like, we're all slaves to technology now. 

And then there's the whole privacy thing.  Like, our personal information is being collected and shared left and right. It's like, do we even have any privacy anymore?  And with all the cyberbullying and online harassment, it's like, technology is making us a lot less safe than we thought. 

So,  I guess the effects of technology on humans are pretty mixed.  It's like, it's good for some things, but bad for others.  I mean, I don't know if we can ever fully escape technology, but maybe we can try to use it more responsibly?  Like, maybe we can set limits on our screen",1
"As school budgets are stretched, some schools are considering changes to the food offered in cafeterias. While this can be a good way to cut costs, there are also potential negative outcomes to consider. 

One outcome could be that students may be less likely to eat the food offered if they are not accustomed to the new items. If students don't eat the food served in the cafeteria, they may not be getting the proper nutrition they need throughout the day. Furthermore, if students are not fully nourished, it could potentially lead to poorer academic performance.

Another potential outcome is that the quality of the food offered may decrease, leading to unhealthy eating habits. Food that is low in nutrition and high in unhealthy ingredients can not only be detrimental to physical health, but can also impact students' mental health and wellbeing. 

Lastly, introducing new foods or changing the menu could cause disruption or even dissatisfaction among students. This could potentially lead to diminished morale and a less positive school environment. 

In conclusion, before making any changes to cafeteria food, school administrators must weigh the potential positives against the potential negatives.",1
"When going through a difficult time, seeking advice and comfort can be a critical step in improving your well-being and addressing your situation. One effective approach is to reach out to your loved ones. Friends, family, or even just someone you trust can provide much needed support and validation during challenging times. You can also find comfort in various online support communities, such as online forums or social media groups. Here, you can share your concerns and gain advice from people who have been through similar experiences. Moreover, seeing that you are not alone can boost your confidence and remind you that you will get through whatever challenge you are facing. Additionally, seeking professional help from a therapist, counselor, or doctor can provide a level of care that is needed during difficult times. A mental health professional can offer personalized advice and guidance that would be tailored specifically to your needs. Finally, talking to yourself in a calming and respectful manner can also be beneficial. Self-compassion has been extremely helpful for anyone struggling through difficult issues, as it promotes self-care and discourages self-criticism. Each of these methods can be used to effectively seek advice and comfort when going through a difficult time.",1
"Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote, “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,” rings true in my own life and through studying the experiences of others. As an amateur soccer player, I never took my skills to the professional level, but if I chose to, I would have had to try something far beyond what I had already mastered. By pushing myself to my limits and rise to the challenge, I would have found a way to develop my skills even further and grow both on and off the field.

The same can be seen in the lives of other athletes. For example, LeBron James has continuously experimented and evolved his game since the day he joined the NBA. By not shying away from more difficult activities and taking on challenges, he has managed to peak as a four-time MVP and become one of the best players in the game’s history. Similarly, Kobe Bryant is also renowned for constantly pushing himself to the limit to become a better player; as a result, he achieved greatness and the opportunity to be gifted with five NBA championship rings. 

Likewise, celebrities outside the sports world have also credited their success to embracing challenge. Taylor Swift is a well-known example; she has moved past her country music roots and released multiple chart-topping pop albums, pushing her career to new heights. In her own words, “You will never grow unless you are willing to try something new. Sometimes that means taking risks, and sometimes it means outgrowing your comfort zone.”

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson’s quote holds true in our lives. We must be willing to solve puzzles, explore past boundaries, and take risks in order to grow and become the best versions of ourselves.",1
" A single person's actions can have a significant impact on the behavior of others. As Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher, once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this statement to be true, as people often look up to and follow the example set by those who are popular on social media or those who have been taught by their parents or teachers. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of setting an example for others and how it can influence their behavior.

First and foremost, observing someone do something that interests you can influence you to do the same. For example, if you enjoy cooking and watch someone prepare a delicious meal, it may inspire you to try cooking on your own. People are often influenced by the actions of others, and this can be seen in the way that young people are often persuaded or pressured by their peers to try things like Juuling.

Additionally, teaching someone to do good by example can be very effective. When a person sees someone else doing something positive, they may be more likely to follow in their footsteps. Parents, for example, often set an example for their children by teaching them good values and behaviors. Similarly, teachers can set an example for their students by demonstrating how to study and work hard.

It is also worth noting that speeches and other forms of communication can influence people, but in modern society, people are often more influenced by actions and examples. For example, the ""Challenges"" that are popular on social media can be a powerful motivator for people to try new things.

In conclusion, setting an example for others is an effective way to influence their behavior. By demonstrating a positive behavior or action, people are often more likely to follow in your footsteps. Whether the example is good or bad is subjective and depends on the individual, but the power of example cannot be overstated.",1
"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Participating in an extracurricular activity can change one's life in many ways, such as making friends, becoming more productive, and finding a passion for something new. In this essay, I will explain why I believe that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity and provide examples from my own personal experiences.

Firstly, participating in an extracurricular activity can help students make new friends. When I was in middle school, I struggled to make friends. I found it hard to connect with people and often felt lonely. However, when I joined the school's debate team, I was able to meet new people who shared my interests and values. Through debate, I was able to form close friendships with people from different backgrounds and cultures. These friendships have stayed with me throughout high school and college, and I am grateful for the opportunities that debate has provided me.

Secondly, participating in an extracurricular activity can help students become more productive. When I joined the school's robotics team, I was surprised at how much I learned and how much I enjoyed it. I had never worked on a robot before, but through robotics, I was able to learn programming, engineering, and teamwork skills. These skills have helped me in other areas of my life, such as schoolwork and future careers. Additionally, participating in an extracurricular activity can help students develop time management skills, which are essential for success in any area of life.

Finally, participating in an extracurricular activity can help students find a passion for something new. When I joined the school's drama club, I had never acted before, but I quickly realized that I enjoyed it. Through drama, I was able to explore my creativity and develop new skills. I have since continued to participate in drama throughout high school and college, and it has been a major part of my life. Finding a passion for something new can be life-changing, and participating in an extracurricular activity can help students discover what they are truly passionate about.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Participating in an extracurricular activity can help students",1
"Winston Churchill is often regarded as one of Britain's greatest leaders due to his outstanding contributions during World War II. He was known and admired for his courage and resilience, but his impressive success did not come without its struggles. Churchill was not one to give up in the face of failure, rather he embraced it as an opportunity to learn and strive for greatness. He was quoted saying, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” His unwavering attitude towards failure was a key factor in his successes, as it taught him to face adversity head-on and push past any obstacles he faced in order to reach his desired goals. Besides perseverance, Churchill was known for his dedication and determination; he continually remained focused on the task at hand, no matter the difficulty. Churchill’s attitude towards failure and dedication to success played a major role in his achievements and molded him into the successful leader he is known as today.",1
"Sure, I'll give it a shot! Here's my essay:

Learning from other people's experiences is super important. I mean, think about it. If we didn't learn from other people's mistakes, we would just keep making the same ones over and over again. And who wants to do that? Not me, for sure!

Like, my mom always says, ""Experience is the best teacher."" She's always sharing stories about what she learned from her own mistakes, and it's crazy how much I can relate to them. For example, she used to always forget to pack her lunch for school, and she would end up going hungry. Now she makes sure to always pack her lunch the night before, so she doesn't forget. It's little things like that, but they can make a big difference.

And it's not just about learning from other people's mistakes. It's also about learning from their successes. Like, if someone else did something and it worked out really well, why can't we try it too? It's like, why reinvent the wheel when someone else has already figured it out?

Learning from other people's experiences can also help us make new connections. Like, if someone else has a similar interest to us, we can learn from them and find new ways to enjoy that interest. Or, if someone else has a different perspective on something, we can learn from them and see things from a different angle.

In conclusion, learning from other people's experiences is really important. It can help us avoid making the same mistakes, learn from other people's successes, and make new connections. So, next time you're thinking about doing something, try to think about how someone else might have done it before you. You never know what you might learn!",1
"I have a unique artistic talent that sets me well apart from others and I should share it with the world. I have always had a gift for painting and drawing, something that has been passed down to me through generations of my family. I can create beautiful, detailed works of art on both canvas and paper, and this ability has been nurtured through my time spent in art classes and workshops. 

Painting and drawing has been a source of gratification and joy throughout my life, so I should share my gift with the world and use it as a tool to bring a little more beauty and creativity into people’s everyday lives. I believe that I can reach others with my art and inspire them to be more creative, to try their own hand at painting or drawing, or simply to appreciate the beauty that is found in art. 

In a world filled with technology and stress, it is refreshing to have the opportunity to focus on more creative passions. My artistic talent is something that I should not take for granted, and hopefully by sharing it with the world, I can help to make a positive impact.",1

Title: The Thrill of Creating New Substances

Hey there, fellow science enthusiasts! Have you ever wondered how scientists come up with new substances? It's not just about mixing two chemicals together and hoping for the best. Oh no, it's a whole process full of excitement and discovery! In this essay, I'll take you through the steps of creating a new substance from chemicals, and why it's so cool.

First things first, we need to research the steps involved in creating a new substance. This means looking up information on different chemical reactions and understanding the chemical composition of different substances. I found some really cool websites that explained how to mix different chemicals together to create new compounds. For example, did you know that by mixing sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, you can create sodium chloride? That's right, table salt! It's like magic!

Next, we need to understand the chemical composition of different substances. This means learning the names of chemical compounds and what they're made of. I found a great website that explained the chemical formula for each compound, which helped me understand how they're structured. For instance, water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, while carbon dioxide is made up of carbon and oxygen atoms. It's like a secret code that scientists use to create new substances!

Once we have a good understanding of the steps and chemical composition, it's time to head to the lab and experiment! This is the best part, in my opinion. We get to mix and match different chemicals and see what happens. It's like solving a puzzle, except instead of pieces, we're using chemicals. I experimented with different combinations of chemicals and saw some really cool reactions. For example, when I mixed sodium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid, it created a fizzing reaction that was so cool!

Finally, we need to understand the benefits of trying new experiments. By experimenting with different chemicals, we can discover new substances that can help us in our daily lives. For instance, scientists",1
"Distance learning, or the utilization of technology-based tools as an alternative to traditional in-person instruction, has become an increasingly popular option in the educational context. Distance learning has the potential to provide students with increased flexibility and autonomy over their learning, such as the ability to work at their own pace or attend to other commitments while still accessing course material. In addition, distance learning makes courses offered by different institutions available to anyone with access to the internet, opening up more learning possibilities.

At the same time, distance learning can be detrimental to some students. Certain students, such as those who do not have consistent access to the internet or reliable technology, may face difficulty in completing their course material in a timely and efficient manner. Furthermore, direct instructions and guidance from teachers can be severely limited in a distance learning environment, which can be problematic for those who require more support in their learning.

Overall, the pros and cons of distance learning must be weighed carefully depending on each individual student's learning requirements and situation. Distance learning can be an effective and beneficial form of learning in some contexts, but it can also be limiting and counterproductive in others.",1
"Title: The Pros and Cons of a Four-Day Work Week with Ten-Hour Days in School

As an 8th grader, I find the idea of a four-day work week with ten-hour days in school to be intriguing. While it may seem like a dream come true to have more time off, there are several implications to consider. In this essay, I will explore the potential impacts on students with part-time jobs, energy and resource conservation, and the potential drawbacks of this new schedule.

Firstly, a four-day work week with ten-hour days could have a significant impact on students with part-time jobs. These students may struggle to balance their school workload with their job responsibilities, leading to increased stress and decreased academic performance. Additionally, they may have to work longer hours to make up for the lost day, which could negatively affect their sleep schedule and overall well-being.

Secondly, a five-day work week with eight hours per day is more energy-efficient than a four-day work week with ten hours per day. With five days of school, students and teachers can spread out their workload more evenly, reducing the amount of energy consumed in the classroom. On the other hand, a four-day work week with ten hours per day would require more energy to light and heat the school, leading to increased resource consumption.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. A four-day work week with ten-hour days could lead to a decrease in student engagement and motivation. Students may find it challenging to focus and learn in a shorter amount of time, leading to lower academic achievement. Additionally, a four-day work week could result in increased traffic and congestion on the roads, as students and teachers commute to and from school.

In conclusion, while a four-day work week with ten-hour days in school may have some benefits, such as increased energy efficiency and reduced stress for students with part-time jobs, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. These include decreased student engagement and motivation, increased traffic and congestion, and the impact on students with part-time jobs. Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day work week with ten-hour days should be carefully considered and we",1

Whether summer projects for students should be teacher-designed or student-designed is an issue that deserves consideration from both perspectives. While teacher-designed projects ensure coverage of important academic content, student-designed projects encourage independence and creativity. A balanced approach that combines elements of both may be most beneficial. 

Teacher-designed summer projects have the advantage of being tailored to curriculum standards and educational priorities set by the school. By outlining mandatory readings, assignments, or activities, teachers can steer students toward reinforcing skills and knowledge that will serve them in the upcoming academic year. This more structured approach helps prevent learning loss over the summer months and guarantees students engage with specific subject matter. However, such rigid requirements may diminish students' enthusiasm if the work feels more like schoolwork assigned against their will.

Allowing students to design their own summer projects fosters independence and makes learning feel more self-directed rather than mandated. When given freedom to pursue topics they find genuinely interesting, students are more motivated to explore subjects in depth through hands-on projects. This kind of autonomy supports creativity and builds lifelong learning habits. Nevertheless, without a teacher's guidance, students' interests may not align fully with educational benchmarks. Completely unstructured time could prove academically unproductive for some.  

An ideal solution would incorporate aspects of both models. Teachers could provide a menu of pre-approved project options within each core subject that relate directly to the curriculum. Students would then choose which one most excites their curiosity to research further on their own terms. By offering structured choices rather than rigid assignments, this balance promotes student ownership while still addressing academic priorities. Regular check-ins with teachers could offer guidance and ensure accountability without taking away students' sense of independence. Such a system optimizes summer learning as both purposeful and enjoyable.

In conclusion, while teacher guidance has value in continuing students' education over breaks, fostering independence through student-designed work also cultivates lifelong learning skills. A blended approach combining structured choice with flexibility may be the most advantageous way to approach mandatory summer projects.",1
"Building self-esteem by accomplishing goals can have powerful and long-lasting effects. Achieving goals can give us a sense of accomplishment, a powerful boost to our confidence, and a feeling of increased pride in ourselves. For instance, if an individual sets a goal to finish a book and perseveres to the end of the project, they can feel a sense of accomplishment from having completed the task. Similarly, if a person pursues a goal to become healthier and meets that goal, they can be filled with an inner sense of pride, self-satisfaction, and enhanced self-worth. 

These feelings of increased self-esteem from goal achievement are different from the sense of self-worth that comes from praise. While praise from others can be encouraging and uplifting, it is more fleeting and does not necessarily fuel an inner motivation to work harder or strive for your goals. However, self-esteem from achieving goals leaves a lasting impression that can be accessed even when no outside praise is available.",1

"As a grade 7 student, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can present some arguments that have been made for and against the use of animals in scientific research.

Arguments for the use of animals in scientific research:

1. Animals have been used in research for many years, and many of the medical and technological breakthroughs that have saved human lives have come from animal experiments.

2. Animals share many similarities with humans in terms of their biology, which makes them useful for studying human diseases and developing treatments.

3. Animal research helps to ensure the safety of drugs and other products that are intended for human use. By testing on animals first, researchers can identify any harmful or unexpected effects before exposing people to these risks.

Arguments against the use of animals in scientific research:

1. Animals are sentient beings that can feel pain and suffer, and it is cruel and unethical to cause them harm or distress in the name of science.

2. There are many alternative methods available, such as computer simulations or cell cultures, that can provide similar or even better results than animal experiments.

3. Animal experiments are often expensive and time-consuming, and the results may not always be applicable to humans. Therefore, the use of animals in research can be a waste of resources and may not always lead to useful discoveries.

In conclusion, the use of animals in scientific research is a controversial issue that requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and harms. While animal research has led to many important discoveries, we must also be mindful of the ethical implications of our actions and strive to minimize harm to animals whenever possible.",1
